        "text": "I've been at this for a fair while, and this is some of the wisdom that I've been told or learned, often the hard way.\n\n**The typical full-time employee costs a company 2-3 times their nominal salary**\n\nUse this as a basis for deciding your rate. $90/hr might sound like an expensive replacement for an employee getting paid $30/hr, but that $90 is the total cost, and stops immediately when the project ends.\n\n**A client asking for 6+ hours in a day will cost you 8 hours**\n\nYou will achieve nothing useful (read: billable) in the remaining 2 hours. They've taken your whole day, but only paid for 3/4 of it. Charge a day rate instead in those situations.\n\n**Make time for downtime**\n\nBurnout is real, and it sucks. If you burn out, you'll lose weeks (even months) of work, so it's better to plan for time off instead. Try to build \"annual leave\" into your rates.\n\n**You're a business, not an employee**\n\nSome negotiation is fine, but ultimately you're engaging in a business transaction, so the client doesn't get to dictate working hours, rates, etc. They can suggest or request them, but ultimately you get to decide when and under what conditions you work. Which leads to...\n\n**Unreasonable requests deserve unreasonable rates**\n\nFor me, \"emergency\"/\"urgent\"/\"rush\" work adds 30% to my applicable rate, with a minimum of 2 hours billed. If I have to drop my current project to \"urgently\" add a line of text to your website, you're paying me *minimum* for the two hours of lost productivity and delay on that other project. I find that if it really is an emergency, clients will happily pay, and if not, they'll prefer to schedule it in like any other change.\n\n**Set business hours, and stick to them**\n\nI work pretty sporadically through the day, and in the evening, but as far as my clients are concerned, business hours are 9-5, Tuesday-Friday. Any requests to work outside of those hours gets met with a 30% increase in rate. Note that this also stacks with the emergency rate (midnight emergencies will cost a minimum of 2 hours at 160%, even if it takes me 15 minutes). If I *choose* to work outside of these hours, I'll still charge my standard rate, but explicit requests will hit the higher rate.\n\n**Be upfront, honest, and candid**\n\nThe _worst_ time for a client to hear about problems with the project is the day before (or after) it's due. If you encounter problems, talk to them early and manage expectations. Maybe the feature you're stuck on isn't actually important enough to delay the project, or maybe the delay is simply communication issues. Either way, talking to your client earlier is always better than later. Often they're understanding, and will approve a minor adjustment to the timeline.\n\n**Hungry doesn't mean desperate**\n\nDon't bother chasing contracts that look like they're going to be trouble. All you'll do is spend valuable time on heartache and frustration. It doesn't matter if you're on your last dollar (and you shouldn't be, if you're charging right, but still), \"no client\" is better than a \"bad client\", because a bad client costs you more than doing nothing.\n\n**If you can't do it, somebody else will**\n\nIf you can't fulfill a request from a client, you can support your freelance community by helping the client to find the person who can, or better yet subcontracting them yourself. Again, be sure to manage your clients expectations, but trying to take on work that you're unqualified for is a fools errand, while being open about it with the client breeds respect and good will.\n\n**Your project is infinitely more important to you than your client**\n\nThis takes a little bit to really sink in, but ultimately this: every business owner is primarily focused on running their business as it is *right now*. For you, your business entails that project, so it's your primary focus. For the client, it's selling widgets, or booking llamas, or teaching sign language to squids. Whatever their business is, your project is not it. This is why clients sometimes seem disinterested, or take two weeks to respond on something that you think requires urgent attention. They're busy running their business, and you're just a risky expense. The *only* time when the client cares more than you is when they're losing money because of a problem with the project.\n\n--------\n\nI'm sure that I could spend hours more dispensing my version of wisdom, but I hope that this at least gives you something to think about.\n\ne: so uh, [this is a thing](https://i.imgur.com/iWYxmxc.png).

Even though it seems like it's \"your work\" if the client doesn't pay, you can get really, really screwed for this kind of malicious, destructive code on a client's website.\n\nThe recourse for non-payment is to sue, not to take down their storefront (even in a very simple way).\n\nThis applies *even if* you're only \"taking down\" the stuff you worked on.\n\nThe way the courts tend to look at it is\n\n1) You're actively hurting their business, which goes beyond just removing your work\n\nand 2) It's not so much that the work is yours and you can do whatever you want with it if a client hasn't paid, but rather that the work *is* the client's and that they are simply indebted to you for it.\n\nThis one might be a little more ambiguous since it's presumably going to be part of the original code, not like using admin privileges or a backdoor to remove your work or something, but I'd still be wary about this kind of thing\n\nI know this is mostly a joke but I thought it might be good for a little PSA for everyone considering something like this, because I hear stories about it a lot. 99% of the time when a client gets mad and says \"I'm gonna sue you for your behavior!\" they're full of shit. This falls into the 1% of the time they might actually have a case.\n\nDisclaimer: Not a lawyer, but have talked to some about what my options are when a client doesn't pay. Also only applies to the US, but probably also for most other similar legal systems\n\ne: That said, I would *absolutely love* to see an e-mail exchange or phone call recording where a client freaks out over this, and the programmer says \"Well it looks like you have about a week left on your deadline, so hopefully you can pay by then or your website will disappear.\"\n\n\"What?? How?? That's not fair!\"\n\n\"The computer just knows. *It's computer magic.*\"",

Being paid in _\"exposures\"_ - or any other qualitative unit - is almost always to be short-changed, when valued in a unit that can compared like-for-like.\n\nIf, indeed, you were confident that your \"alternative\" payment, when valued in a universal currency used by the rest of the planet, were worth the same value as the fee, why on Earth would you not pay in cash anyway? It's easier to track, exchange and spend - being accepted worldwide, readily stored in a bank, and easily handled digitally. It can also be invested, unlike _exposures,_ which tend to have a fairly short shelf-life.\n\nThe answer, of course, is that 9 times out of 10, when one runs the numbers - the alternative is worth very little indeed. **And incidentally, I'm pretty sure _that's_ why my rent is charged in Pounds, not _exposures._**",

        "text": "I've seen a lot of negativity about freelancing and people's inability to find \"jobs\". So I figured I'd share my story to maybe push people along that were considering it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a web developer that started on Upwork less than 2 months ago. Someone suggested the platform to me so I looked into it and signed up. I quickly put together a website in less than 8 hours showcasing my skills, and put together a few \"mockup\" websites on editors like Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don't think I'm super good or anything. I do have several years of experience graphic designing and Photoshop, but that was just \"for fun\". Sure, I'm an engineer, and while that sounds good on paper, I didn't learn squat about web development in any of my classes. I googled pretty much everything I know, from SEO, to web design, security, css/html/javascript... and I don't know nearly enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, with my website up, I bought the Upwork monthly subscription and used all my connects applying for jobs. Surprisingly, within a day, someone offered me a contract to build their small website for $400. I took it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithin a week, I had 4 jobs, 2 fixed price contracts, and 2 hourly for 20/hr. Using less than 70 connects. I had to turn down job offers because I had too much on my plate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was like oh, sweet. This is easier then I thought. Once I finished my fixed price contracts, I was curious. Hmm.. Now that I have reviews on my profile, can I up my price?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I started applying to jobs at $35/hr. Within 2 days I had two new contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I was like... okay, this is getting ridiculous. There's no way I'm worth this much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I had finished my other contracts, I was genuinely curious if I could start applying for 50/hr jobs and actually get them. I didn't think I'd get any bites and only applied to 5 posts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days later, I had 2 offers for 50/hr. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, that's where I'm at now. I haven't tried applying for anything higher, but once I get a few more sites in my portfolio I don't have any doubt I can up my cost to $65. I'm just going to keep going up until I'm comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my applications, I really don't do ANYTHING special. I have a copy and paste that I use that includes my website URL and skills. I tailor like, one sentence relevant to the job post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first, I thought I was getting lucky but things have been too consistent. I don't work full hour weeks yet I'm making $4,000+ a month doing what I love, from home in my pajamas. It has been amazing, and I'd encourage to at least try it, especially if you're struggling to make money.",

You used to have to have a suite of expensive equipment just to edit a video to tape. Now you can do it on your phone.\n\nSo my advice is this:\n\nDon't like a design you saw? Re-do it for your portfolio and website.\n\nWhat's as important as the final design is  show your process and explain your design choices.\n\nYou want customers or companies to hire you? It's as much about how you think as much as it is what you do. A designer needs to able to communicate visually and verbally.\n\nYou're going to need those soft skills to manage your clients or stakeholders and convince them to follow your direction.\n\nIf you're going to do it for free, do it for yourself.",

At first, I would bend to a potential clients every need, anything to get the gig. Of course, this landed me in some truly shitty situations.\n\nToday, I was talking to a guy about doing some work on his rails app, all totally in my wheelhouse. I got the codebase, started looking through it, running it on my local machine, etc, it was all normal and fine. He then sent over his list of what he wanted done and asked for a time estimate on how long it would take me. Ok, cool, all normal.\n\nI asked him to give me a moment to look it all over so I could give him an accurate estimate, to which he responded, “Good, take your time because I don’t pay extra if you misjudge how long it will take you”. Maybe that’s a fine and normal response, but the way he said it just didn’t vibe with me. With that, I told him that I didn’t have the bandwidth for the project and good luck finding another dev!\n\nI am just sharing this to say that I’m proud that I am overcoming my scarcity mindset and learning to set good boundaries. There is plenty of good dev work for me to do for people who don’t come off like ass holes. \n\nAnyhow thanks for reading. May you all have a prosperous 2020!",

A project isn't done when you've gotten paid for it. It's done when you get positive feedback in the form of a testimonial, Yelp review, etc.! You can even collect quotes from clients over time and ask if it's ok to use their testimonials for whenever you finally decide to make that portfolio website you've always been saying you'd make.....

        "text": "I've noticed a lot of posts lately about contract terms and how to handle clients that don't pay.\n\nEven though I'm not a lawyer (and this is not legal advice) I picked up a few tips over the years that I think can help. \n\n**So I wanted to share how 12 little words can help make sure you always get paid — on time, even if the project stalls.**\n\nBut before I get there, here's some evidence to show how well these tips have worked for me over the years.\n\nAfter freelancing for more than half a decade, I have *never* had a client skip a payment to me. And I've worked my way up from projects for under $100 total to more than $10K a month.\n\n(I'm not trying to brag — I only want to illustrate that I've worked with all kinds of different clients. And that these tips will work for projects of all sizes.)\n\nLike anything, your mileage may vary depending on your industry and services. And you should talk to your own legal person before betting your business on ideas from a Reddit post.\n\n**But here are the 12 little words I added to my contract to make sure I get always get paid (on time — even if the project stalls).**\n\nThere are two parts, and they go in two places in your contract:\n\n**PART 1. \"Upon full and final payment...\"**\n\nEvery contract should have a part that says the client gets the copyright to the work created. Put these five words at the beginning of that section.\n\nSo you'd say **\"Upon full and final payment** ***\\[...client gets the copyright\\]*****.\"** That way you've made it clear that, until you're paid in full, you keep the rights to your work.\n\nClient doesn't pay? Client doesn't have the right to use what you make. And if they don't respond to gentler techniques, you've got the threat of a legitimate copyright infringement case on your side. That will get their attention — and almost always get them to pay.\n\nAnd if you really wanted to go \"nuclear\" — you could threaten to sell the rights for what you made to a competitor. You'd need to have the means to end the contract without giving them the rights, though. And if you can keep some of the money, too, then they will have funded work for a competitor.\n\nNo business would want that — so you'd almost certainly get paid — but they'd never work with you again, either. And they might even spread a bad reputation about you in your field. So **do not** do something like that lightly.\n\nAlways, always, always use the smallest amount of force needed to fix client conflicts. You can always escalate more the next time you follow up if you want. But it's almost impossible to deescalate after you've gone in with guns blazing.\n\nWith that in mind, here's the next tip...\n\n**PART 2.** *\\[Payment is due upon completion...\\]* **or \\[MONTH DAY, YEAR\\], whichever is sooner.\"**\n\nIf you've ever had a project get delayed — and your payment along with it — this one is a game changer. At least it was for me.\n\n**Seven words** can make sure you get paid on time if you charge a flat project fee spread out over a few payments. For example: 50% up front and 50% when you finish.\n\nIf you don't get paid until the project is finished...then every time the project gets delayed, so does your last payment. And if you have a disorganized client, the project may *never* come back...leaving you SOL.\n\nThat's where this technique comes in. Instead of saying you get paid 50% up front and 50% when you finish, you say...\n\n**\"***\\[...and the second 50% is due upon completion\\]* **or \\[MONTH DAY, YEAR\\], whichever is sooner.\"**\n\nBoom.\n\nNow you've got it in writing that if you don't finish by the date listed, you can charge the client the final payment anyway. That way you can wrap up at the client's pace — however slow — but you've gotten paid when you need it. (You can also set a deadline to complete the work, too. But that's a topic for another day.)\n\nThat's it — 12 little words that can help make sure you always get paid — on time, even if the project stalls.",

Value is value.\n\nHourly rates are great to talk about when you’re trying to discourage a client from expanding the scope of work: quote a large number for an hourly rate on anything that exceeds the stated scope. In the proposal phase, this helps the client to think hard about whether the proposed scope is appropriate, and allows them to make adjustments before committing. \n\nSaid another way: *hourly rates should be used prophylactically to discourage scope creep.*\n",

        "text": "I am writing this as more of an advice post than anything else. I don't claim to have some 7 figure software development agency, but I've been beating out most of the local freelancers here and make a decent living. I worked at a SaaS startup in the valley, got sick of the 80+ hour weeks and high cost of living once I had a kid and moved back to my hometown with no job or prospects. I realized quickly that landing a few clients as a freelancer would be easier than finding a job someplace, especially because the job market is unusually bad in this area of the country.   \n\n\nThis is catered towards web and mobile development. Also assuming you have the skills and/or connections to pull off most jobs.  \n\n\n**Target Small Businesses**\n\nAnything over 25 employees and 2-3 locations, I don't even bother. It looks like a big payday at a medium sized business, but there is a lot of bureaucracy and they typically have a full-time staff member (at least at the time) who's job is to shop around for stuff. Small businesses don't have the time to compare you with 10 other agencies or freelancers. They are essentially going to compare doing it themselves versus 1-2 quotes from freelancers or agencies in the area. Small business owners want a \"will this help me?\" verbal confirmation, medium sized businesses want a large detailed proposal that takes up way too much of your time as a freelancer. Agencies have people who's sole job is to write proposals, and they do it fast and well.  \n\n\n**There is nothing wrong with tossing if it's the only thing within their budget**\n\nI get it, your god's gift to programming and/or graphic design and you must do everything custom and perfect. I am a vile piece of garbage that devalues your work and brings a bad reputation to the industry. That's a great mindset and all to have, but I have mouths to feed. If you look at your client's business, I almost guarantee they are typically reselling stuff anyway. If it's a restaurant, that Sysco truck shows up a few times a week. If it's a store, it's probably a bunch of made in China products. Guess what, your client is perfectly ok with you using a template and getting something online quick if it saves them money. They aren't expecting you to build something from scratch. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a competitor quote for $10k+ to make an overly complex, built-from-scratch design on magento for a lady that sells candles at the flee market every other Saturday.  \n\n\n**There's lot's of side work the client will pay you for**  \nI've charged $100+/hr just to setup some Zapier integrations between a client's CRM, Email, and billing system. I am contracted, I don't need to do them a favor every time they need something simple done. These people can't even set their own DNS records without getting on the phone with O365 support for 2 hours, trust me they really appreciate the help. They have a business to run and their time may be more valuable than yours. Don't be there IT person, make that clear but you can probably step in where their IT person can't. Most of those in-house IT guys only know windows administration and basic network troubleshooting, not much else. Make sure to have a clause in your agreement that everything outside the scope of services is so many dollars per hour. Of course, get verbal confirmation regardless before you send them an invoice for a few hundred dollars.  \n\n\n**Americans love monthly payments**  \nI know that Dave Ramsey wouldn't agree, but it's a part of our culture that isn't going away anytime soon. If a lead won't close, take that $20k job and charge an initial setup fee. Split the remaining amount into 12 or 24 monthly payments and have them sign a contract. Host it for them, don't provide the source code until the payment plan is completed. They don't pay you? Pull the site down. I know some states have laws against this, so it won't apply for everyone. Most small businesses don't have excess amounts of cash laying around, half the time they are taking out loans just to cover payroll. Yes, I've had businesses break the contract on me but I'd say it's a 10% average.  \n\n\n**Cold emailing works**\n\nI've always been shaky about this, as I don't like to be bothered myself and if you were to cold email no matter how good the message or offer, I'd delete it right away (I guarantee it). However, not everyone is as experienced with internet communication as we (tech people) are and they do actually read the emails sometimes. It's about volume, go ahead and build lists of certain industries within your geographic region (that you are ok driving to) and rotate out targeted campaigns that you tweak overtime. I used to spend a lot of time researching individual businesses and making super detailed emails with suggestions etc but the response rate was almost the same as my \"question about {Company}\", 2 lines in the body email that I send out on drip now. Just A/B test all your cold email templates, I personally use Mailshake but there is a lot of other stuff out there. Last month I sent out 900 emails, got 20 responses, 5 of those met with me in person and I closed 3 of them. \n\nWarm-up a new domain for cold emailing that is similar to yours, I can't stress this enough as I lost some business last year because my main domain got blacklisted and emails were dropping with real clients. Make a very similar \"[yourbusinessmail.com](https://yourbusinessmail.com)\" or \"[getbusiness.com](https://getbusiness.com)\" type of domain, let the domain sit for a few months after registering and sign-up to random newsletters and respond to a few friends so the domain/emails warm up.  \n\n\n**Focusing on your local region is better than Upwork and other platforms**  \nI wish this wasn't the case, there was a time back in college where I actually made a lot of money on those platforms but now it's too saturated. There are more devs than leads and someone will always do it cheaper than you, and these cheap devs are doing so many projects now they've actually become half-way decent at it. I've had more success with in-person sales and cold emails. I know it's not for everyone, most freelancers are not social butterflies. I did work as a car salesman for a couple summers, so I think that really helped me at sales.   \n\n\n**Mobile Apps Close Leads**  \nYes, the business WILL make almost all of their sales through their website. They don't believe that, they want a mobile app that goes along with their site. I've had this argument, I've tried to do the right thing and not sell them something they don't need but at the end of the day it's an ego trip for them to have \"Such-and-such Business\" app on their iPhone they can show off to customers/friends/family. If you are designing somewhat complex websites, you can make mobile apps. The learning curve isn't difficult, it's almost expected in 2018 that you make mobile apps along with the site.  \n\n\n**Nerd talk sucks**  \nYou've already lost the sale if words like \"programming language, data structure, load-balancing, etc.\" comes out of your mouth at any point while you are pitching. I get that this is great if you are selling to a tech firm, but probably not. They want \"This is a picture of the site or app, this is the what the buttons will do\" and \"This is how you get paid on new site or app\". If they have a weird request that would be outside of their budget, simply state that. Don't give them the tech reason why it would cost more.  \n\n\n**Monthly retainers!**  \nHost their website, update the content, and tweak things for a monthly fee. Don't separate out the hosting cost into itemized things, just give them \"$300/month\" or whatever you want to charge. Be firm about the amount of hours you'll spend and give them a steep discount if they prepurchase hours in advance. Some months I don't do anything, some months I do have to spend that 10 hours or whatever it is I promised them. Subscription business model is awesome! Go research it.  \n\n\n**Build a network of freelancers you outsource to**  \nNot talking about an agency! I am an engineer, I don't even have adobe illustrator or photoshop on my PC. I contract all graphic design, which is funny because I am at the point where locals here drop me as a guy that does logos and print materials. Taking on more jobs in the long run will increase your profits, don't get your head wrapped around doing everything yourself and turning away clients because of it. We are more like a \"team\", and when they need certain work done that they can't do they contract me to do it   \n\n\n**Automated payments are awesome!**  \nThere are a lot of invoicing options out there that will store their credit card details. I personally use Invoice Ninja, it lets you send an agreement for them to sign and ask for their credit card details right away. Clients are lazy when it comes to writing checks. Sure, credit card processor fees suck but so does not getting paid. If you are doing any monthly payments as mentioned above, make sure to include in the contract that you are allowed to charge them automatically.  \n\n\nAfter reading what I wrote, it seems really predatory! Swear that I am not. I do like bringing value and new tech to local businesses. Just some things I've learned along the way, I hope they are of some use to you.",

There is such a thing as the Freelancers Union, and I am stoked at what they are doing. However, it feels like they can only do so much. Am I wrong or do we need a movement for freelance designers, or freelancers in general? Are there ways to fight against such blatant and devastating devaluation of our industry? Or are we just going the way of the dinosaurs? Small businesses are strapped for cash and can't afford what we need to be charging to pay the bills.

Is there a source on this?\n\n> convincing clients to pay what we are worth\n\nThat's always been a problem since the beginning of the industry. Don't believe me? Ask your father. If he doesn't know then you may want to ask why he doesn't know anything about it.\n\n> With a quick google search of the words \"logo design\" one can find an entire page of $45–$5 logos with insane DIY software or web apps that are completely destroying the value of custom brand identity design.\n\nWhere are you finding these fabulous logos in the real world? People who are buying $5 logos are not going to pay the rates for a full branding package or even a simple custom designed logo. Get over it. Move on. Be better.\n\nIs Coca-Cola buying $5 logos? No. How about any Fortune-500 companies? Nope. You may find some in the 200-employee range, but if they have a marketing budget they more than likely know that they need to spend money to improve their image. Most people buying $5 logos can't afford any more. Why work for companies that don't have a marketing budget anyway? It's like blood from a stone.\n\n20 years ago you could buy CD's full of thousands of pre-made logos. The industry survived that...\n\nLook, this same argument and the same fears have been circulating since the advent of advertising and graphic design. It got worse with digital editing. Quark Xpress will destroy the industry! How can a skilled photographer compete with a mediocre one with  Photoshop? Wordpress templates will cancel the need for web developers and designers! These are all real panics that have hit the industries over the past 30 years, and yet the industry persists. If you go back far enough you'll find people complaining about paper putting stone tablets out of business. Whatever. It's the same old story.\n\n> Am I alone in this or do you guys feel this struggle too?\n\n\"The struggle\" is that you need to push for clients who have money and stop worrying about those who don't.",

                "text": "Unionizing is about leveraging collective bargaining power to lobby for better pay and benefits for *employees*. Freelancers aren't employees, they are *small business owners*, so the very idea of a union for them is essentially price fixing and is probably illegal. I do like the idea of an organization dedicated to establishing and communicating best practices among freelancers, but again \\- freelancers are business people and they will break that guidance the moment doing so gives them a competitive advantage.\n\nI think the better solution here is to make sure you're truly viewing yourself as a BUSINESS, and conducting yourself accordingly. I noticed you used the \"quick google search\" as an example for how bad competition is in freelancing, and herein lies the problem. If you throw yourself into a vast sea of competition (like Google search or Upwork) that appeals to the laziest and cheapest grinder clients on earth, you're going to have a rough go of it. The way out is to *narrow in and target a niche market that values what you have to offer, specialize in that niche, and become the go\\-to provider for your service within that niche*. Just like any successful small business must do.\n\nAs a random example, there are a few freelance designers I've found who specialize in making app icons for mobile game developers, and they have honed their craft to the point that their work is basically untouchable by some jack\\-of\\-all\\-trades UpWork yahoo. They understand mobile game app icon design like few others do. They have an uncanny ability to encapsulate a game's core idea into a single icon, and with a design sense that perfectly appeals to the app's target demographic. They produce highly effective product for a very narrow market. That's their niche, they study that niche and stay up on its trends. Their marketing is tight, focused and well packaged to appeal to their narrow little market \\- game developers. These artists make great money and are booked months in advance, so they can pick and choose, charge more, and only take projects that will be great portfolio material. No cheapo grinder would even consider emailing them because it's clear they do stellar work and charge accordingly. They are in the driver's seat.",

This is going to be problematic during an enrollment conversation. Especially since being a designer in your specific case, is the brand creation business.  \n\nBecome a branding expert. Your income will increase substantially as a result.  \n\nAlso, just for some context, what you are describing has always been the case. (Going back to the days of non-reprographic blue keyline and wax stick.)  \n\nIf you are competing on price, you are fucked right out of the gate. \n\nWhatever high-tech solution you are imagining, there was a similar low-tech solution filling the same market position in the recent past.  \n\nI suspect that what you are finding is that freelancing is competitive and that people want to spend as little money as possible to get the job done. I don't expect that to ever change. You have to create the perception of value. That's what branding is about. \n\nIf you want to be successful, you need to figure out how to be a Mercedes rather than a Kia. (And with that written, even Kia is figuring out how to be a Mercedes and not a Kia.)   \n\nEven with automation technology, we are still a ways off from graphic design and brand-type logos going the way of vinyl records and cassette tapes.  \n\nI remember having this same conversation repeatedly 2 years or so after the original Mac 128k came out. Everyone was suddenly a graphic designer or layout artist. Ain't nuthin' changed.",

It is the same problem but individual freelancers don't have any protection from it, especially creatives.\n\nWhere I live, my luxurious flat's rent is $300 a month. Where you live, maybe you're paying $3000 for a modest dwelling. Your living expenses too, are perhaps an order of magnitude higher. I can undercut you by doing similar work for half your price and still make 5X more than you (adjusted for living expenses). I can do it for 90% less than you and break even. You can't compete with that.\n\nI'm not even talking about low quality work here. There are fantastic artists, programmers, musicians, graphic designers living in 3rd world countries or worse. With some, you studied in the same schools. They just went back. With some, you were born in the same city, they are just digital nomads.\n\nThat is your real competition and there is no easy fix here. The people paying peanuts for low quality work get what they paid for, shit work. Some learn, some don't. You don't want them as a client anyways. And some don't even believe in the value a brand identity might provide for them - and they may be right - maybe their positioning in the industry doesn't call for it and they want to have a logo just because they can say they have a logo and nothing else.\n\nAs I said, your real competition is talented people living in cheap places. Unless your country sanctions those countries where they make it illegal to do business with those countries (kind of like what happened to Iran vs. USA) your only bet is convincing your clients that physical proximity matters for the work you do. It might not matter in the end of course.\n\nTL;DR: No union will save you from your potential client doing their business with me instead. My living expenses are a lot lower than yours and I live on the other side of the globe. I can beat you on the price. And talent (sometimes)..",

        "text": "I started freelancing about 4 years ago exactly and now have 10 years of professional experience. First couple years it was mostly consulting gigs where I'd work hourly in various company offices with their design and development teams. This paid well but wasn't the lifestyle I wanted. I was trying to get the top dollar hourly rates without having to commute into the city. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward two years, I created an agency (even though it was just me) landed a couple sizable contracts for various dashboards/custom content management systems etc... Somewhere along the line I began mentoring a young aspiring developer and got him to a point where I was able to pay him on a bi-weekly basis. I was on the cusp of being able to make money by managing subcontractors! Ended up striking out on the first one but ended up working with a talented designer overseas. He does amazing work and over the last 2 - 3 months I've brought him into various projects for my primary client. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've built a lot of trust with my client and they are growing like crazy so i was eventually able to sign a 6-month full-time consulting contract for both myself and my designer/subcontractor for $144k\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter paying him an excellent rate (especially considering his living expenses) I'll be able to net 117k in just 6 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI essentially more than doubled my highest ever paid salary when I was full-time. Crazy! Anyway, what I've learned is that trust is everything, for projects 5 - 6 times cheaper I've had to negotiate back and forth many times often losing the deal because I was too expensive. With my client that trusted me, he saw the proposal and within an hour or two gave me a verbal. I was blown away at how easy it can be once you prove your value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, happy freelancing everybody!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: updated figures to be accurate and not ballpark",

He ran into the same problem, people wanted all the plans for what they were going to do, then they'd go do it themselves.\n\nThis is the same things as going into a brick and mortar store to see a product and then going to Amazon to buy it for 1/2 their price.  You waste the salesperson's time, the brick and mortar invests in stocking the product and you go online to get the best price you can.\n\nOne guy was very bold.  He asked about a NOS (network operating system) and I did the research, found a solution that was very cheap compared to the one he was looking at buying.  He ordered it, I bought it, delivered it, he paid by check, opened the box, installed the software and stopped payment on the check saying the product didn't work and wanted a refund.  He was very rude and when I came to pick up he was running the software on his computers.\n\nWhat he did was illegal from stealing the software to stopping a check, but I didn't have the time to do anything about it.\n\nPeople don't follow the law, they don't respect the time you spent learning your skill.  I can go on and on with these stories of being screwed over by both big and small companies.\n\nWhatever price you quote, they want a discount.\n\nHad a friend that opened a gym, paid 10K for a software package I told him I could write for $500.  His 10K package never worked and they never refunded him the money...  My software always worked and was very advanced.\n\nUnderstanding humans is very important.",

I find that many younger designers are struggling trying to get into the trade and compete with a global marketplace. Older designers are also trying to hold on to whatever work they have and are not maturing in their careers - it's creating a poisonous environment for everyone involved, except those at the top. Just look at the startup ecosystem.\n\nI'm approaching my 40s, but still in the trenches working alongside young ones on same kind of bullshit I was working on 15 years ago. It's a race to the bottom and you're not the only one having these doubts. In past few years I've been building my own small offline business in an entirely different industry in hopes of making the switch full-time within a year or two.",

Best decision of my life. Been with the company almost 10 years now, and have progressed onto a senior designer position. Great benefits and retirement, and it's less than 4 miles away from my house.\n\nBefore that, small agencies would just use you until they could find someone cheaper out of college, or keep you stuck in the junior designer position until you got fed up. Freelancing was almost just as similar to me. Seems everyone thinks they can get cheaper work because a friend of a friend \"knows graphic design.\" At my age right now, there's so much fresh talent out of college that love working for cheap, just to get gigs.\n\nRight now, I just kinda stay on top of things. I do print and web design for my company, but in my spare time I keep fresh with other aspects, from learning Premiere and After Effects to even some web development. Just in case things take a turn for the worst, I can at least have a broad set of skills.",

Getting new clients takes a lot of time: You may get one client and you're working for a month, but then you have to think about getting more clients while working otherwise you will experience a period of downtime.\n2. Freelance projects are often cheap: As a freelancer, find clients with a reasonable budget is hard.\n3. Clients can be difficult to work with: because their 'expectation per dollar' ratio is so high\n4. Doing it alone is hard\n\nIs it just me?

Someone once told me \"look for work before you need it\" and I've taken it to heart.\n\n**2-3:** Stick to your rates and the quality of your clients will go up. This is completely anecdotal, but my clients that have been willing to pay me what I've asked have understood what they're paying for; my expertise.\n\n**4:** 100% agreed.

        "text": "I keep seeing people in this sub asking \"is this a scam?\" about a particular situation. Usually, the answer is \"yes.\" I just wanted to cover some common \"scam\" situations to help you understand and avoid them.\n\nWhen you have a contract, life is good. The money is coming in, you're eating steak instead of ramen, and you buy wine in bottles instead of boxes.\n\nWhen you don't have a contract, panic often sets in. This is when many freelancers get scammed because they're _vulnerable_. Don't let this happen to you.\n\nRemember, most gigs are straightforward: you get the job, contract gets signed, you do the work, you get paid. Yeah, there are disagreements at times, but that's business, not necessarily an up-front intent to scam.\n\nHere's the rule of thumb for freelancers: if the gig _isn't_ straightforward, or if it's \"too good to be true\", it's time to be suspicious because there's a good chance you're going to be taken for a ride.\n\n# Pay To Work Scams\n\nAlmost all of the scams are designed to get you to pay them instead of the other way around. While there are legitimate services where you pay up front (some freelancing sites), they are the exception. Any time someone _asks_ for money up front, research the hell out of them. Usually they're a scam.\n\nI think the most common one is \"because of \\[insert random situation here\\], we're sending you a check for too much money. Cash the check and pay someone else.\" \n\n**That check will bounce.**  Any money you paid goes to the scammer. Never accept this; it's a scam.\n\nSometimes it's \"pay this registration fee and we'll start sending you lots of work.\" Pro-tip: no, they won't.\n\nSometimes it's \"you must buy our software and work with that.\" I've never heard of a company legitimately asking for this, but the scam exists.\n\n**Summary**: If you have to pay to work, it's a scam.\n\n# Pyramid Schemes\n\nThese might look legit, but they fall in the \"seems odd\" category and are often illegal. If you lose money, you're a victim. If you make money, you might be a criminal co-conspirator.\n\nThey work like this:\n\n1. You represent the company's products.\n2. You buy the company's products.\n3. You convince family, friends, or anyone else you can find to represent the company's products.\n4. You get paid a commission on the products they buy, _and_ for the people you recruit!\n\nDon't do this. It's not only unethical (most people will spend far more on products than they will earn), but it's also often illegal, but it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Multi-level marketing is a type of pyramid scheme which is often legal (Amway, Avon, Herbalife), but only a handful of people make a living off of it. However, if you get paid for hitting recruitment targets, there's a good chance the company is breaking the law. Do heavy research here. You're probably getting scammed.\n\nIf you still want to do this, check [MLMWatch](https://www.mlmwatch.org/) for the company's history.\n\nAlso, generic \"work from home for $X a month!\" usually falls in the MLM/Pyramid scam schemes.\n\n**Summary**: If you have to buy their stuff and resell it, it's probably a scam.\n\n# Account Detail Requests\n\nIf anyone is asking for your _private_ information for Paypal, your bank, tax forms, or anything else, no matter how good the reason, walk away. They're going to clean you out. People still fall for this, but then, desperate people still fall for Nigerian scams.\n\n**Summary**: Don't give out private info. Duh.\n\n# Payment Isn't Money\n\nMany times, this isn't a deliberate attempt to scam, but the end result is the same: you produce value; you receive nothing.\n\n\"Exposure\" is the most common. It's naïve people who offer this and naïve people who accept. Politely say \"no\" and walk away.\n\nProducts or services? That's also almost certainly a \"no thank you\" and walk away. You can't pay rent with those.\n\nEquity? That's also a \"no thank you\" and walk away. Nobody offers random freelancers on the 'net equity. **If and only if** you know the opportunity up front, you know the people involved, you understand the risks and rewards, you are willing to accept long hours for no pay, and you have an iron-clad contract _that you have run past a lawyer who specializes in this type of law_, then you might ... just might ... consider equity. But you're probably better off saying \"no.\"\n\nSide note about contracts for \"equity\". I've a friend who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity because he submitted a security patch to a popular open source product. Due to his contract terms, the company \"owned\" that patch and was demanding that it be reverted or my friend give up his equity. Reverting the patch would have exposed thousands of sites to a serious security hole. He gave up his equity because the open source product probably wasn't going to revert his patch and he was going to get sued down to his skivvies and lose. Get a lawyer on that damned contract. (Note: the intellectual property laws where he lived favor employers, not employees).\n\n**Summary**: You get paid in cash. Period.\n\n# How to Avoid Scams\n\nResearch the company. Research the people. If you can't find them, there's a good chance you're going to be taken for a ride. Don't just take a referral on good faith and **don't let friendship cause you to skip details**. Many friendships have ended poorly when they get into business together.\n\nAnd if anything seems \"weird\", it's probably wrong. Now go out there and make money!",

Don't work for anyone who insists on those terms. Again, look at who is telling you this. Is the company shutting down? Are employees, including your contact, going without a paycheck?

        "text": "I already wrote about this 2 times [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/dwagms/my_client_is_about_to_scam_me/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/e1kzen/have_paypal_ever_sued_you/). To recap: I made a logo and app design for a client. They only payed for the app 2 moths late, they never payed for the logo. In one moment I took down their access to the Figma project where was the app design (they could copy it for 2 months but they didn't). So after 5 days they started the dispute process over PayPal. I was quite demoralized since all the comments I found on reddit were saying that it's almost impossible to win a dispute over digital product. But in my second post some people wrote me that they won disputes over digital products, and their input was very helpful.\n\nGood news is that yesterday I got the message from the PayPal that I won the dispute! I have to thank all the community here that gave me valuable information and support, without you and my colleague I would not make it. Thank you all!\n\nSo just to tell you what happened. If the customer starts the dispute process on PayPal you have about 10 days (not sure how long exactly, but not more than 2 weeks) to solve the issue yourself. So you can chat together and maybe find a solution, after 10 days period if you don't solve it PayPal will decide who is the winner. Other option is that either client or you call in PayPal to moderate the dispute. If this process is started than PayPal decides who is the winner, and buyer can't stop the process.\n\nSo in my case the buyer started the moderation process. Than PayPal gives you the opportunity to write them your explanation what happened, and to send the documents supporting your claims (jpg, png, pdf). For this text they give you only 2000 characters. My original explanation had 9000 characters, since the case was quite complex. I made a short version with only most important info that fitted in 2000 characters, and I made a PDF document with the full explanation of what happened. In the beginning of the message I wrote something like \"More detailed explanation in Detailed\\_explanation.pdf\". I also sent screenshots of emails and chats that were supporting my claims, I also refereed to this screenshots in both shortened and detailed texts. I can't tell what was the most important point in my explanation of the conflict but somehow it worked.\n\nI'm still scammed for 500€ for the logo that they didn't pay. But at least I know that they payed for the app design they don't have access to anymore. Now this gave me a bust in morality to try again to negotiate with them, but first my lawyer will send a letter threatening with a lawsuit. \n\nLesson that I learned:\n\n1. I should stop using PayPal for selling digital products, since majority of people have problem with it (Square, Stripe and Skrill are suggested as good alternatives)\n2. Never start a new project without a formal contract, 50% money up front, 30% in the middle of  the project and 20% at the end. Provide the product only after the final payment is done.\n3. Never continue working if the client is late with the payment.\n4. Have a good nose for a shitty clients. Watch out for small details, mine was super friendly, but didn't pay the logo when it was done and asked me to continue working on a project. Because we had a good communication I thought he is OK so I trusted him.\n5. Document everything, ask for all agreements to have a written form. Record all the calls.\n6. Try to still have a faith in humanity that not every person is a complete asshole.",

I can get someone from the Philippines to do it for me for less than 5 bucks an hour.\" I am aware that many prefer hiring cheap workers to save money, but having someone bluntly say that to my face, it felt different. Even though I know many went through this as well.\n\nIt was so so so tempting to say \"Well, if that's the case, why haven't you hired them yet then?\" Or \"Good luck. Let me know if you need someone to fix their mistakes.\" (Not saying they are bad at their work. For this specific job he needed a full strategy, marketing plan, social media management, etc for a brand in a language that is non-native to their country. That is why I applied, as I live here and am a native speaker. I assume he'd make them use google translate or maybe translate himself)\n\nNot sure what I want with this post. I took a break from the Facebook groups, Upwork, and other sites I am on. I feel so unmotivated! Tired of joining everyone else in the rat race. I absolutely refuse to lower my prices, I know what I am worth but most importantly, I know what I need to charge to be able to pay for my bills. Less than $5 an hour isn't going to pay mine.\n\nEdit: Didn't expect all the comments. Thank you all for the kind words, encouragement and critism, and advice :)",

It surely sounds like a tantalizing deal for the client! *Just think of the thousands they'll save by paying $285 for 57 hours of work.*\n\nMy standard, practically automated response is simply 'quality, speed, and professional experience with someone who cares about your success will cost money. I respect your investment and wish you luck with lower-priced alternatives.' Typically it leaves most people very confused and feeling as cheap as they sounded. They're typically never a business I want to deal with if they so boldly comment on pricing. It only gets worse as they nickel and dime you into poverty, so it's a boat I'm happy to push off the dock and watch burn.\n\nChin up. You're not in competition with people in international markets with rock-bottom rates. Their quality may even be identical (or better) but there's always something you'll be able to offer that brought even the offensive clients to your door. Clients will come as long as you're competitive and qualitative. Honestly, I think I feel worse for the international freelancers who charge $5/hour to handle these sorts of clients. Just because currency conversions may make it more worthwhile doesn't mean they're not grossly underpaid operating in a foreign market. After all, isn't the dream for anyone to be paid equal pay for equal work/skill? That shouldn't be so geographically locked to be paid a fraction of your worth.",

        "text": "I see a few freelancers posting about clients asking them to do extra for a flat fee - that's not good for you as a freelancer,  since the more you do for a fixed amount, the lower your effective hourly payment. It's a way that an unscrupulous client could take advantage of an inexperienced freelancer.\n\nMany freelancers have stated the vital importance of having a contract - an official agreement between a freelancer and a client that defines various aspects of how you'll be completing work, payment terms, pricing, expectations etc. One thing I strongly recommend putting into a contract is wording that defines what is in and out of scope - in other words, what you will provide as part of the fee. Below, I've included wording from the contract I use (I'm a freelance writer):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Out of scope - What is not included in the price**\n\nAnything not listed under “Scope” in Appendix A is not included. Any reasonable requests for additional work will be considered. Any requests for changes must be made by the client in writing. Any change to the scope of the work after acceptance by the writer may be subject to additional charges. Should such changes negate any part of the work already completed at the time of the changes, the client accepts responsibility for payment for any work completed to date.\n\n**The writer agrees to:**\n\n* Carry out work to the scope, quality, deadlines and prices listed in Appendix A and as agreed via other written communications.\n* Provide original, high-quality writing as requested by the client.\n* Follow any special instructions provided by the client and agreed by the writer.\n* Treat the client with professionalism, courtesy, honesty, and integrity at all times.\n* Respond to any communications within a reasonable timescale, normally within one to two days.\n\n**The client agrees to:**\n\n* Provide supporting information, topics, guidance, article ideas, and other material as requested by the writer to allow for creation of the work.\n* Provide a word count, deadlines, and other relevant information about the requested work.\n* Answer any questions asked by the writer.\n* Provide prompt feedback on outlines, work, articles, and other content as requested by the writer.\n* Promptly pay the deposit and fees as stated and invoiced by the writer.\n\n## Appendix A - Scope of work, turnaround times, services, and pricing\n\n**Scope of work**\n\nProduce content for the client.\n\n**Turnaround times**\n\nTwelve working days from original request.\n\n**Services and pricing**\n\nAll services will be charged at the prices listed on the writer’s website, here: xxxx\n\nMore information on what’s included in these services below.\n\n**Original content creation**\n\n* Research - Gathering, consolidating, and reviewing information to allow for the creation of the work.\n* Writing - Creation of original work, free of plagiarism.\n* SEO - Appropriate use of SEO / keywords in text, titles, and headings.\n* Editing - An internal review of the work to ensure high-quality English use.\n* Email communications between the client and the freelancer.\n* Two reviews of the work.\n\nAdditional reviews after the first two will be charged at a flat rate of **$xx** each. I can also source royalty free images at a flat fee of **$xx** per article and upload content to your content management system for a flat fee of **$xx** per article.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has helped me push back on what clients have requested, and keeps everything very clear. I've never had any issues with clients signing my contracts, so I believe these are all reasonable terms. Note that I am not a lawyer, so consult with a legal professional about exactly what should go into your contracts.",

The theme is all about how true happiness, isn't empty material things, but comes from human connection, caring and sharing.\n\nLots of it to be illustrated with character animations. The first draft comes back - with instructions to reduce the number of characters & have fewer. Fair enough, no problem.\n\nClient still not happy at 2nd draft & points to particular points in background scenes, where characters don't look like they are \"from the same family\".\n\nThis was was strange, as it was the first mention of people needing to look related. But I looked at the specific points in the video asked. Then it dawned on me what the client was asking.\n\nCould I get rid of all the black people and people of color from their video about caring & sharing.\n\nSigh.",

We categorically refused. And refused. And refused. Told her that she needed a different photo. Finally we darkened the entire picture, increased the contrast - all tastefully, mind you.

        "text": "I see that there are 2 categories of freelancers depending on how they behave when a client has mistreated them or have not paid. One group contains freelancers who better avoid fighting for their rights and move on; but I belong to the 2nd group as I really don't want let them go unpunished. So, I had this client who had anger issues and he was not trusting any freelancer and treated them miserably. But he somehow trusted me at first and hoped that I would become his right hand (I'm dealing with project management and marketing). After a month of working together I got more and more convinced that I better fire him as soon as I can since it was just a matter of time when his anger issues would be targeted to me and he would start mistreating me like he did with other freelancers. So as our contract stated, I informed him that I want to leave eventually and I will find my replacement and teach him/her how to proceed. But the client  lost it. He got totally angry, within 30 min he kicked me out from all working tools and blocked me everywhere, and pretended that he doesn't exist.. But he pretended that also my 2 weeks salary also didn't exist. \nAfter multiple reminders, a final letter before an action, I just sent court documents using european small claim procedure 😊😊😊😊😊 Very proud of myself. In fact, I realised that EU has a very good and convenient procedure for cross country small claims, so if you and your bad client live in the EU, it's definitely a convenient option. I'm also proud because this client was always bragging that freelancers don't have guts and I shouldn't worry to mistreat them as they never complain and can't do anything. Surprise surprise... Well, let's see how it goes...",

It's been HARD because daycare is sooooo expensive and I am struggling to keep up with billable work and doing stuff to actually improve my business. It has felt like every last dime has gone to either daycare or software and taxes etc. My husband took a lower paying job so he wouldn't be gone 13 hours a day and our savings is dwindling while I try to build momentum.\n\nI just got a call from an old client who was paying me a pittance last year to do kind of tedious/frustrating though very doable work on a project that eventually languished because they didn't have the internal bandwidth. I almost didn't call him back, as I am charging way more now and wouldn't work with them again for my previous rate. He didn't even pause when I told him my new rate and insisted I immediately send him an invoice for 40 hours so he could get it in under this year's budget and we'd restart the project after the new year.\n\nWe haven't done any Christmas shopping. All our pets are overdue for the vet. My license and tags expire next week. we need vehicle repairs. Groceries. And we have like $75 to get us through the week.\n\nExcept it's all going to be ok because I did good enough work that my client is eager to prepay me almost $3k to restart this project. I feel like a boulder just rolled off my back.\n\nSometimes things work out.",

Easy breezy beautiful ;)\n\nEDIT Proof of concept: Quite a few people asked me how to easily execute the above, well if you're running Wordpress I put together this fairly simple integration with the plugin eForm + Stripe - https://www.creativemade.com/retainer/ - \"Hey I'd be happy to get started! I just need a payment on file to get started. This will take at least two hours, so as soon as I have a payment on file for that I'll knock it out\".\n\nWithin eForm, it's a pricing table element, with a dropdown element that comes up for the hours (with conditional logic if user selects hours), and lastly a payment element that goes through Stripe. Very easy setup :)",

        "text": "I don't know if I'm breaking the rules but I need to vent a little bit and hear from other people who might me struggling like me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have terrible anxiety. Not always, but most of the time. Apparently, it's related to a fear of rejection, or something like that. I'm getting help (free therapy from psychology students!), I'm fighting every fucking day in my life to get out of it and get better and better, both emotially and profesionally. Neglecting my own well being and social relationships, I've managed to have a few nice clients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a video editor, motion designer and photographer. Or maybe neither of those, I don't know. I'm proud to say that most of my work is related to social inequality, specially in education. I just shoot some video this morning at a \"second chance\" school. I'm also editing a couple documentary movies.  And I'm filming my own documentary! Actually, all that looks great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then my great, wonderful, amazing country points at me with a huge, sticky and bloody finger and says: \"fuck you\". 2/3 of my income is gone in taxes. To be fair, I wouldn't mind that much if corruption wasn't as obvious, if hospitals weren't falling appart and rent prices weren't so astronomically high. I just looked today at my bank account. I have 5 fucking euros, 40 more in cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm fucked, I'm absolutely fucked. I shouldn't use that money, because I already scheduled a shooting day in another city to do my fucking movie, and I will need it to pay for the bus tickets and to have lunch pretending that I can actually pay for lunch in front of everybody. Because I had no other fucking idea than to do a movie about anxiety to help everybody deal with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat same anxiety that keeps me awake at night, that prevents me from asking for more money to my clients because I don't think I'm worth it, that makes me live in a constant state of fear. And the only think I can think of is \"work harder, work harder, work harder\". I shouldn't even be writting this, I have to finish designing a document. But I don't know how long I can keep on doing this. I don't want to work at burger king. This is the only thing I know. But it feels like this is a never ending nightmare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so fucking scared. I feel like I should just kill myself of go to the streets and set the world on fire. I won't do any of those because I just won't. But the feeling, the thick heavy feeling of failure and self disgust... Fuck. Just fuck. A thousand times fuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: A little update. All your replies have been awesome, thanks. I needed to take some distance and you all helped me see the situation from afar. TBH, anxiety isn't always present as a constant feeling, it has its ups and downs. Lately it has been growing, and last week's anxiety was unexpectedly big. I went to the shooting last weekend. After all, it wasn't too expensive and I will survive until I get paid (eating mostly rice, though). Considering that it's something I'm doing to eventually escape this crappy situation, I was focused and motivated, and I think the interview I shot was great and super interesting. I've spent some time trying to understand my feelings, why do I feel the way I do, as my therapist asked me to do. Today I've been with her and she says I'm doing great understanding myself and finding where the problems are. So, TLDR, progress is slow, but constant. Anxiety is always there, it has been growing, but I'm fighting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and one of my clients is getting some extra funding from the EU and is willing to pay me more for my work. I didn't even ask for it. They just apreciate my work, which feels nice. Definitely good news!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks, reddit. You're awesome when you're trying to help.",

                "text": "I am in UK, but can access EU (yes even post Brexit)\n\nYou earn whatever you want until you reach and exceed the income tax amount: usually around £10,000.\n\nTo live a good middle class life you probably want to earn £30,000.\n\n£20,000 is a starting point in a half decent job.\n\nWhat I am saying is, you can earn up to a certain amount legally before paying tax; but of course you want to earn a lot more than the tax amount so as to live comfortably.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Spain I am unsure of the situation. From being there last year for a week I saw the political problems, literally on the street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) Tax Threshold, Trade & Gifts**\n\nFind out about your tax threshold, how much are you allowed to earn before you have to start paying taxes.  \n\n\nIf you are earning not much more than the taxable amount; then perhaps file for unemployment; give your clients cheaper rates in order to keep them on and keep your income below the taxable threshold. Working cheaper but avoiding losing all your money to tax. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are earning a lot more than the taxable amount then I can see your issue.\n\nI would then wonder about having a discussion with certain clients and see if you can move to a favors-gifts-friends basis rather than a professional client.   \nThis may be unwise or perhaps dodgy; especially if you tried to make all your clients \"friends\" who provide \"cash gifts\" for your help. There may be one or two clients you feel close enough too or can trust; or perhaps can explain you are being over taxed but want to keep on working.   \nThere may be an option to change your contract or invoices with clients to break their payment up so less of it is taxed... you would need to get advise and make sure you aren't breaking any laws. But perhaps if the invoice was the same cost but outlined different aspects of what the money is for; eg tax could be charged to the client on the invoice?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) Tax Year, Profits.**\n\nConsider the tax year, what you declare and how that works. Perhaps because you are making profit that gets taxed. Maybe spend it all as business costs, or look into what tax breaks there are if you purchase things under your business rather than personal. Upsides are obvious...downside is you lose that stuff if business fails. Eg buy a laptop, new software, coffee machine, big lunches to cover your dinner etc your coffee intake, etc all as business costs rather than personal savings if you can avoid the tax.\n\nAdvise from business charities or read up on government and EU websites? Tax breaks, VAT off your products, charging clients after the tax year or have them pay later on?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) Get Advice.**\n\nSeek more advice!Yes reddit is good, but mostly opinion. If there is a EU advice center or local charity to advise you? Google EU business startup advise?\n\nBeing part of the eurozone should have certain benefits; and perhaps also consider moving to a digital business and claim you are working internationally for clients outside of Spain. Check out the EU business advice websites to see if they help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) Anxiety.**\n\nIf you can, for free, go to the Doctor and talk about stress, sleep, tax, risk of depression. UK has NHS. Perhaps Spain that isn't possible. In this case, go to a good church! Seriously, even if you feel unworthy or disagree with the beliefs, finding a good church; or charity; finding just one person who will hear you out and point you in the right direction will make the difference. There are people who want to and love to help other people; just need to think where are those people found at; a good charity or church (maybe more independent rather than the state church or state charity)Many independend churches will have group things, coffee sessions, lunches etc even a point of contact for people in mental health crisis. You don't need to be about to kill youself; even just if you are a bit down and need motivation. I would consider this; even just to have a random person to vent too and then move on.\n\nAt the very least, find a real life person to speak too. The internet does have forums etc but may be too easy to vent and complain online rather than converse with a real life person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5) Unemployment Benefits, Sick benefits.**\n\nSee if you can or what you must do to sign up for some benefits or unemployment.Cover yourself by only providing the information which is requested. Don't go into too much detail.\n\nDo what must be done, go to meetings, phone calls, provide evidence you are searching for work (even at burger king, or looking for new clients perhaps?)\n\nCopy everything, photograph forms, photocopy, get staff to sign anything they say to you, do not trust what people say on the phone; get things in writing.\n\nSee if you can get a Doctors letter or whatever goverment form signed by a professional health worker/Doctor to show you are anxious and need months off work with government sick pay scheme. Find out if this is an option and if this is appropriate or suitable for you. It may be too much work and you may not be anxious enough for this. Consider what options you have, speak with doctor or even with receptionist if you have to pay for Doctor... Knowledge is Power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6) Communicate with Your Current Clients**\n\nCommunicate with your clients... if you do need to stop working explain you will be not working for a limited time... 1 month or 2 ... in order to keep them in the loop for now. Thank people, don't give reasons or say you are stressed... best to frame things positively in the professional world... eg \"I am taking time to travel, learn, study, re structure my business, time to relax, catch up with family... etc and encourage others... even if you feel like shit... encourage the people who give you work.... be open that you arent working for a short time and will soon be back!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7) Burger King**\n\nAs for burger king... Most people know what you mean and most people feel the same.\n\nI would consider a shit crappy job but with NO public interaction... in other words, you know you gotta put in some hours of work to get money... so cleaning offices, early hours out of site jobs, delivery jobs, stock room roles. Personally, I find if you just need to show up, do some task, get the money or expect to get paid and headhome its quite good actually. Maybe posting stuff, walking about for a few hours just posting things?\n\nIf working Part time with the public ensure it does not drain you. Have business cards for your own busienss and hand them to people while working.\n\nI used to work in cafes and coffee shops. People sometimes would get chattng and I would give them business card for graphic design work back when freelanced at that. So some roles can feed into your business and get you clients.\n\nI would advise avoid public if you just want the money for the task and then want to head home and work with clients... consider part time work like that which is doable and suitable for you. Burger king would be rubbish unless you were clearing one out or setting one up... think about it that way...paid to power hose the place down after closing time... or to clear out and old one or set up a new one. There are opportunities in lots of weird places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope there is improvement for you and you're able to keep working and find a way to make sure that money goes into YOUR pocket while you pay the fair taxes.",

        "text": "Before starting my own business, I'd been working toward it for the longest time. It's all I wanted.\n\nThen in 2015, I moved countries and finally had the time to start my own business. It's a social media marketing business, and I've been able to perform well, get to a really high project rate, and build up a good portfolio. I had my best month ever last month in terms of income.\n\nYou know all the perks: working when I want, where I want, defining the way I work, what I wear, and the decisions that are made within my business. Sometimes I take the train to the beach on Fridays and work from there.\n\nIt fulfils my values and my ideology: it's different than what most people are doing, I have independence, and I don't have to follow arbitrary rules. I'm not a cog in a machine.\n\n**But I just don't think I can do it anymore.** The constant worry I'm going to let down my clients, anxiety that my work isn't going to last, constantly searching for new work so I can continue to make money...it's gotten to a point where it's completely overwhelming and unsustainable.\n\n**But I don't feel like I fit into society either.** The arbitrary rules, the condescending attitudes of the people who take work too seriously, the people who assert that their way is the \"right way,\" I can't stand it. And I feel like a complete outsider every time I even go into the city. I can't see myself being proud of wearing another business's logo on my shirt and being fully invested in it. I want to do MY thing.\n\n**But I've got to do something.** Of course I have to have a way to earn money, and I want to be happy at the same time. Also, my wife has saved heaps for our future and I haven't been able to contribute much aside from being ultra-supportive and taking care of smaller things (logistical stuff like paperwork and stuff while she's at work).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love any advice on how you've gotten on after coming to a crossroads like this.",

Can you contribute to your home life in other ways than money? \n\nAnyway, to me it sounds the best times have yet to come, if you can find someone to talk about those fears with.

No one here will (or at least, should) be trying to convince you to stay freelance unnecessarily.  Its perfectly fine to go back to a more standard day job.  And then back to freelancing again if you want to.  \n2. I fairly strongly believe that most people who freelance are looking for freedoms that you don't actually get from freelancing.  You don't really get to be your own boss, you just now have more but weaker bosses than before.  I think that the inevitable direction of freelancing is one that moves your business towards productized consulting and eventually into something like a true product of some sort (infoproduct, saas, etc).\n3. Raise your rates. ",

I had a great client that wanted to extend work for me and a couple small clients in the pipeline.  \n  \nBut I thought the verbal contract extension was good and I got lazy. After weeks of being ghosted I went back to upwork.  \n  \nI treated upwork for what it was and focused on people who wanted actual good work, expert freelancers and reasonable budgets. 25 proposals later I landed a ~10k contract. This morning upwork sends me an email that I need to verify my account in order to submit new proposals and withdraw money.\n   \nSo I hop on a chat for a video call. I'm asked my address, fine. Then i'm asked 2 python questions... one being \"How do you identify a block of python code in python\". I'm like wtf does that even mean. Like anything in a file that isn't commented is \"code\" but the lady couldn't help.  \n    \nAs a second chance question, I'm asked how to do a function overload on the syntax \"//\". Seriously wtf is this. Now in 24-48 hours they will get back to me about my \"permanent\" account status.  \n   \nStay very, very far away if you can and the age old truth nothing counts until it's cleared in your bank account. Even then straight cash in hand is better.\n  \nEdit: looks like they approved me in spite of missing the two questions. Still wary something like this will happen once i have more earnings",

It may help filter out the shitty and unreasonably clients, but even good relationships have a potential to go sour.\n\nNote as well that the point of having a contract is not to empower you to win legal conflicts, but to avoid them altogether. Most legal conflicts come about because something happens and nobody can agree on what to do about it. A good contract should anticipate things that can go wrong and provide a solution for how it should be resolved, so that things don't escalate into a full-blown legal dispute in the first place.\n\nNow does this contract do that? Not at all. It doesn't even define what the designer is *doing* for the client. It doesn't explain what the \"check\" is for...is that a deposit, or a full up-front payment. What happens if there are delays? What happens if the work takes longer than expected? What happens if the client isn't happy with the work? If they require more edits than the designer is willing to make?\n\nHonestly, this contract is so devoid of substance that it might not even be legally enforceable at all.\n\n**TL;DR - plain language contracts are a great, but this particular example is garbage**",

I was new and by no means needed the work, but I was certainly looking for the hours and it was still a reasonable rate. \n\nAnyway, on going work. Pretty meh, not overly interesting. He was nice enough but his emails were so jabby, just the way he wrote them I always felt like shit reading them. It was also unresponsive and the relationship just stopped... like one day I don't know who but we never answered each other and it just stopped. That was like Jan 2018.\n\nHe reached out at the start of the month. Wanted to work together again. I'm busy now, I remembered the negatives of the project and was hesitant. I said sure, but my current clients are paying me \\[$20/h more than my original proposal 2 years ago\\] (this is true). I thought that would scare him away and it didn't, so we're working together now. \n\nHere's the take away though. No one has touched the code since I was last in there 2 years ago, and I'm SO MUCH BETTER than I was then. Like so much. I'm cussing my former self out, solving problems I thought were impossible at the time. Making things prettier, faster. I've just been living and breathing this shit since then. And he deserves to be charged for that, as do the rest of my clients. \n\nYou're improving at what you do every day, and you should be growing your rate to reflect it.

The whole \"charge what you're worth\" thing has really backfired. A growing number of the new people we've used are not worth half what they charge and their work is sloppy and downright bad. You can't charge premium prices and deliver subpar work. What is the rationale behind charging a minimum of $45 an hour regardless of what they're doing and level of experience? This should and will vary widely depending on experience, skillset, and education. There is no way I'd pay an entry-level content writer/blogger $45 an hour when the market is saturated with good writers. At the same time, I wouldn't expect a mid-senior designer to be charging anything less than $100/hr. \n\nAt the end of the day, all freelancers need to have realistic expectations about a role, project, and the compensation. \"Worth\" is not an arbitrary number or amount.",

Some even go so far as to not consider adult freelancing as \"real\" work. Additionally, you're talking physical versus mental and/or remote labor for a lot of freelancers. Again, many people have preconceived notions.\n\nI'm not saying, btw, that it's impossible to get the money or that freelancers shouldn't charge what they're worth. I agree wholeheartedly.

        "text": "I just completed a project for a client. He took the software to a trade show and actually won a prestigious award for it. The agreement was for the job to be broken up into three payments.  The last payment to be due a month after his project was delivered. Tomorrow is the due date for the final payment and I get this email:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind that I have fulfilled all of my obligations to him except of course delivery of the root password to his server. He obviously hired someone else to work cheaper who is local for general maintenance. I really understand and don't blame him for doing that. I am pretty upset that he is either trying to delay the last payment or weasel out of it completely.\n\n>Mike,  \n>  \n>I believe we are coming up this week on your final invoice. Prior to us  paying this invoice, I need you to release 100% of the software to us.  (you may have already done this - I just need this verified by a third  party) This is something we spoke of in the beginning and a few times  since. Your concern is that we may do something to damage the program. I  am concerned about that as well.  I also would request that you  continue to offer your support services to us for our continued  development of the front end and potentially some back end changes. This  would be at your hourly rate of $80.00.  \n>  \n>It would make sense for us to use Brad for changes to both. He has  experience in both. He just does not have experience the same as yours.  We would of course agree to paying your fee of $80.00 per hour to assist  with the intent being for us to use you, Brad and others to help if and  as needed down the road. We have had inquiries from some that want  their \"own\" front end for their customer base. This will require further  development to allow us to be able to license it.  \n>  \n>Brad has advised that he understands before making a single change to  anything we have already paid you for the development of - he must first  make a secure copy of what is in place and only modify and test the  copy before going \"live\" with it.  \n>  \n>Brad will need a few days - probably through this coming weekend to be  able to review everything we send to him to be sure he has access/what  he needs to work on any \"back end\" modifications and may be calling you a  few times. This is approved by me for extra billing.  \n>  \n>I appreciate you and all you have done Mike. I believe what we are  building will change our industry.  It has officially become patent  pending and won a very prestigious award!!  \n>  \n>Bill\n\nI replied with this:\n\n>Bill,  \n>  \n>As agreed, I expect full payment unconditionally by tomorrow. After I  receive the payment I'll give you the root password and the instructions  to access the rest of the software which is on your server. Please  understand that when I give you the root password and those  instructions, that I cannot be held responsible for whatever is done to  the server when someone else is tinkering with it. The source code for  the admin program will not be made available to you as per our  agreement. The admin program is just a collection of CRUD tables anyway  and can easily be replicated in any language by any programmer if you so  desire. I will be happy to assist Brad at my regular rate that will be  invoiced to you weekly and payable immediately.  \n>  \n>Regards,  \n>  \n>Mike\n\nI would very much like the input of other freelancers regarding this situation.",

        "text": "Not sure how many of you guy work from home and have a family but it can be a total sh\\*t show at times. Focus can be damn near impossible. I've got my 2 yo and 4 yo running around, along with my wife popping in. Here are a few tips to make life easy:\n\n1. Sit down with your kids and make a sign that you can put on your office door that tells them when they're allowed to come in and when they aren't. Me and my daughter went to Dollar Tree, bought a P.J. Masks dry-erase board with a chalkboard on the other side. On one side we drew a happy face (you're allowed to come in) and we drew a sad face on the other side (daddy has to work). It's working like a charm.\n2. Loop a YouTube white noise video through your headphones. This one has been my favorite: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMfPqeZjc2c&t=14052s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMfPqeZjc2c&t=14052s). There are times when my wife and kids are home and I don't even know it.\n3. If you've got one car like we do and the wife takes the kids out all morning, buy a bike so you can sneak out and work at locations near your home. \n4. Invest in a big monitor. I started out working my laptop. Then, I used a 19\" TV my sister-in-law gave us. After three years, I upgraded to a 32\" Samsung curved monitor and I will never use anything smaller than it again.",

It's a funnel and the more you put in the top the more eventually drips down to the bottom. \n\nSome clients will never respond to the first email, others will schedule an appointment and miss it, others will make the appointment and not hire. Some will \"hire\" and then change their mind. You can try to optimize each step of that chain but ultimately the only way to grow your sales is start putting more in at the top. And not take anything personally. \n\nThe sales part of the job should never stop, even when you're busy. Until you've got regular clients booking you solid: you're a salesperson.\n\nSince you're doing this online you'll have to figure out a way to market yourself online...

On the flip side, if you frame your work in terms of the value that you create for the company (quality, specific outcomes, etc), these are intangible benefits. The price is negotiable. ",

        "text": "I've noticed that lately my hours have been way under. Like on my own personal time tracker I was logging 10 hours per week for a client, and Upwork said I was only logging 6 hours per week. \n\nAfter contacting Upwork support I've finally found that my issue is they deduct time if you aren't moving your mouse frequently. Most of my work is consulting, so I host a Zoom session and coach the client through my microphone. While I'm doing this I'm not really typing or moving my mouse, so it tracks very little time. After going through my logs I've noticed I had a two hour consulting session and it only logged 20 minutes. \n\nUnfortunately, Upwork's response to this is to simply move your mouse more during consulting sessions. I've tried this, and it still seems to be deducting time. I have recently started also typing gibberish into a notepad during the call, and that seemed to do the trick(even though it's distracting, as I'm trying to actually coach the client)\n\nIf you do any sort of consulting via video conferencing make sure to manually track your time, or else you probably won't be getting paid the hours you actually work.",

        "text": "Just wanted to post my story for who feels like the constant hustle isn't worth it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always loved sports and wanted to become a sports journalist, but I studied media production (audio/video) and was in a time consuming band throughout my college years, so I never took the time to volunteer on the school paper or get an internship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took a job hundreds of miles from home working in digital media, but I began writing on a Philly sports blog (I'm from Philly) to stay in touch with the local sports and keep my dream alive. I would spend 5-10 hours researching, analyzing film, taking notes and writing these pieces for no pay. My full-time position requires that I work 8 hour office days M-F then travel on weekends to run events and work 12 hour days. Needless to say, every spare moment of free time I had was dedicated towards writing and improving my craft. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy coworkers called me crazy (super positive influences on my life as you can tell). I also started a sports podcast to utilize my audio production skills and fulfill another childhood dream of being an on-air sports personality. No pay, hours of work, my parents sometimes the only listeners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I stumbled upon UpWork and learned about non-sports related writing opportunities that came with a paycheck. It was difficult to sell my writing with no prior experience outside of sports and no proof of success on UpWork. After agonizing over cover letters, trying to use my writing skills to mask the lack of relatable work experience. Finally, one tech company took a shot and asked me to write a 400 word blog for $20. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was ecstatic and determined to produce a piece that would blow the client away. I submitted it and received a thank you from the client. A few nights later she messaged me again and let me know that she couldn't believe how well written the piece was and that she really appreciated my stellar work (upon checking out the blog, it seemed like she was working with people who didn't really care about the depth of their content and I simply put more time and effort into it, so my work likely wasn't anything special aside from that). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, I gained a repeat client who consistently rates my work five stars and provides positive feedback. That led to a steady flow of awesome opportunities. I wrote copy for collegiate athletic webpages, produced email newsletters for a former NFL player and was even paid to produce a piece on Michael Jordan vs. LeBron. I was getting paid to write about sports. More than that, I discovered that I loved researching and writing in general, not just sports. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn less than six months, I went from slaving away at lengthy sports blogs for no pay to a consistent $150-$200 in side hustle per month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week, I applied to produce a sales email for a client. He was so happy with the work I produced that he wanted me to write ALL of his sales emails for the entire year! I'm now locked into a 19-week contract earning roughly $100 per week to write 6 emails, about 3-4 hours of work per week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that I am beyond fortunate and that there are way too many clients on UpWork offering less than 0.03 per word. It's a little bit sickening. And I hope that UpWork's new payment plan for connects helps fend off those low ball offers and opens more doors for dedicated freelancers. But when it seems absolutely hopeless and like the door is never going to open, don't give up. I also understand that I only do this as a side hustle and the stressful burden of finding enough work to make an entire living off of it is a monstrous mountain that I'm not ready to climb quite yet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut don't let ANYBODY knock you down and discourage you from pursuing a career that leaves you happy and fulfilled. Drown out the negative vibes and surround yourself with a positive core of support. That's why we're all here. To support each other. So write your heart away until the gate opens for you. I would advise to write about something you're absolutely passionate about. In doing so, you'll form versatile writing skills that can be applicable to a multitude of opportunities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPower on and never give up!",

        "text": "So I have an agreement with a client for a body of work. With a little bit of luck, I will finish off the project today. The agreement is a little complex - it is to provide a body of content for them to build in to a training session and then for me to review that finished product before they release it AND to review and approve 8 specific resources (specifically names in the agreement) that they have also developed. Today, they sent me through a 9th resource (only one extra) and asked me to review it.\n\nI saw the email and thought, \"It's only 15 minutes work if the document is fine, I'll just do it.\" But then I open it and there are two sections which say, \"Brad-corp - what should we put here?\" And I'm like, WHOA!! Pump the breaks. It was always scope creep, but now it's gone from 'read this and make minor corrections' to 'read this, make corrections where necessary and provide additional content and extend your liability to cover this and anything our people do with it.'\n\nSo I've had to go back and point out that reviewing and contributing to this document was not in the original agreement and is in fact scope creep. I pointed them in the direction of where they could find the information they need to complete it themselves, but then included in my response that if they would like, I am happy to undertake the request and it will cost $xxxx for me to do that and it will be 2 weeks. If they need it sooner it will be $xxxx+20%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's see if I can turn a sneaky scope creep in to money in the bank.\n\nEdit and update - \n\nApproved instantly. I received a call immediately after sending the email which had nothing to do with the request. I apologised for the push back and was reassured, \"It's completely fine, I've sent it off for a decision.\" We discussed the other issue in the email and fixed that problem. In less than 10 minutes I received an email back with approval for the spend - including the rush fee!\n\nIt's not a massive earner - but I'm really pleased with the result!\n\nDown side - need to spend a few hours working on the weekend :(",

        "text": "(Sort of a rant but any observations welcome too!)\n\nI've been doing this for four years (albeit only a portion of that full-time), but some of the crap I see from freelancing clients never ceases to amaze me.\n\nI've just started working with a client that needs a large volume of content for various affiliate marketing websites. I won't say in which vertical out of fear that it might give some clues as to who they are.\n\nI'm charging a pretty basic rate but because it's bulk work (and I've worked with this client before) it's worth my time. It will be boring as hell but a nice chunk of steady work for a few months.\n\nRemember ... this is SEO-optimized web content meant to build links and get people to click affiliate links. Really basic stuff — not exactly writing that's going to be in line to win the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nTheir new editor sends me over their new style guide this morning. It's an ALMOST FORTY PAGE PDF and just about the most ridiculous document I have ever seen.\n\nThere are something like a hundred nitpicky rules regarding punctuation and how to spell out certain acronyms. (Again, I don't want to specify what the rules are, but studying this encyclopedia alone would take a day.) It advises looking over the top three Google results for the keywords and then setting out time to plan how this will be the best possible article on the subject ever written. It says about a hundred times that they need the very best of the very best and that all these rules must be followed to produce that.\n\nI get that they want quality. But for what they're paying, and the nature of the work, this just seems like ridiculous overkill.\n\nAt moments like these I wonder what planet some of these clients live on. How do they manage to live in the developed work (meaning they must have some idea of what's a reasonable request for a budget) and wind up with expectations that are so wildly out of line?\n\nIt baffles me.",

        "text": "I really really just need to vent about this. I'm really sorry about the length. TLDR at the bottom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI became a graphic design freelancer last year because I had to move countries (this is a very long story and irrelevant for now) which led me to loose my then current and beautiful job at an amazing firm where I had incredible freedom, projects and just overall great everything along with a great supportive team. The new country I moved to was *supposed* to be a temporary move and I was *supposed* to be moving back in a couple of months so I took it as a nice vacation at first. Eventually, my plans to move back fell through and I had to wait much longer than anticipated so I started doing small work for family members and friends FOR FREE (I know... but I cared about them and I was supposed to be on *vacation*). \n\nI guess this is a time when exposure actually paid off and people that saw the work I had done began approaching me. I started getting *real paying clients*. I decided to take some of them because I could really use the money at this point and I had no complaints so far. It was seemingly great, I mean... Who wouldn't want real paying clients to show up at their doorstep? Who wouldn't want to be able to work from home on something you loved? Who wouldn't want to be able to charge as much as you want and make some great portfolio work? It seems like this is the current dream for so many people and I had so many people telling me \"You're on the right track!\" \"This is the dream job\" \"Forget about what you were doing before, this is better\" \"Be your own boss!\" and I believed it for a while, I really did. I was proud of myself. I did some really good work that I was proud of at first. \n\nUntil the anxiety and the pressure started settling in and I started realizing that I started loosing things that I genuinely cared about and loosing my mind. I realized that I hated running into my clients at the grocery store and having them ask me how progress was going. I realized I hated posting anything on social media because I feared that my clients thought I wasn't spending all of my time on their projects. I realized I couldn't enjoy free time anymore, I couldn't work on passion projects, I couldn't do anything that wasn't work for my clients and think about my clients all of the time. I couldn't sleep without thinking about how much time I was wasting. I couldn't go for a run anymore without spending 90% of my runs thinking about how quickly I could shower and get back to work. I couldn't play video games anymore without thinking how my clients might somehow find out I wasn't working right now. I was borderline paranoid. My family members would ask me how the work was going and I hated answering because it would make me feel guilty for not being hard at work right at that moment. I would dream about my clients hating my work and complaining to my family members/friends behind my back. I avoid talking to my family just so that they don't have the opportunity to ask me about my projects. I became a hermit, I can't be social anymore. I deleted my LinkedIn because God knows why actually, I'm not even sure why I deleted it myself. \n\nI am so anxious, stressed and paranoid all of the time. I used to be so good at managing these feelings, I used to take on lots of work out of pure joy and want but I can't anymore. The money and independence isn't worth it to me. I don't want to be paranoid, I want to be able to socialize again. I want to talk to my family without worrying about how I'll answer their questions. I want to be able to do work I am proud of again, not just work that \"does its job and pays the bills\". The things I miss the most about working with a firm was the support of the team, the vetting that they were able to do on clients and the fact that none of the clients knew my family or shopped at my grocery store. I miss the freedom that that gave me. I know freelancing is supposed to be a great way to freedom but working in a firm is a different type of freedom that I really enjoyed. \n\nAnd I know it seems like I shouldn't be complaining about having such a great opportunity to do freelance but I don't think its for me. I don't think I'm the right person to be a freelancer. I've been afraid to say this because everyone is always shoving down my throat how awesome and how great of me it would be if I started my own thing. But I don't want to anymore, at least not at this point of my life. Freelancing is not for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I started freelancing about a year ago. Got a lot of paying clients quickly. Did really well for a bit. Anxiety, stress and paranoia settled in and now I hate it. I want to go back to working at a firm. Freelancing is not for me.",

(It's natural and arguably more productive to have enjoyable free time.) You could also try finding other clients that don't live in your geographic area or know your family/friends--sometimes a bit of professional distance can be helpful. It would definitely drive me crazy if I ran into clients at the grocery store!\n2. Or, you could see it as a learning experience: you tried freelancing and have realized it's not for you. You've learned that you prefer working for an organization, where there is an established structure and when you leave for the day, you're gone. (There's also the social aspect to having a job that is lacking with most freelance work.) So now, when people bring up the possibility of you doing freelance work, you can knowingly, happily decline.\n\nI wish you the very best!

I feel like I've seen a few posts here talking about anxiety and problems with maintaining a work-life balance. I just wanted to say, that freelancing is not for everyone. It's not for me, at least at this point in my life. And that's okay. \n\n\nFreelancing is made out to be a great deal, be your own boss, work from home. And as with everything, there are pros and cons. For me the cons of constant financial anxiety and stressful client communication have outweighed the benefits of self-employment. And frankly I never wanted to run a business.\n\n\nAll of this is to say, it's okay to quit freelancing. And it's okay if you find out it's not for you. You don't have to push through or prove anything to anyone, especially if it is damaging your mental or physical health. And these issues may be just my own mistakes of not setting boundaries or other best practices. Or because I haven't been in business long enough. Either way, transitioning to full time employment feels right for me at this time. \n\n\nI applaud anyone who has been doing freelance for long term and is able to support themselves or a family with it. That takes hard work, skills, and immense dedication. Keep on keeping on!",

        "text": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/80yvr8/im_freelancing_for_an_agency_and_its_starting_to/).\n\nSo, I read over all of your guys' advice (thank you so much), and decided to email her outlining the following:\n\n* My times for availability for answering emails and doing work\n* If you email me outside those times, tough luck. I'll get to it the next day, after my full time job.\n* That I require a full project scope, via email, upfront. Anything that comes in outside of that is billable.\n* That I require a deposit upfront for any future projects.\n* That I had completed the scope on the current project, and anything additional will now be billable.\n* I need ample heads up on a project. Not, \"Hey, do this. It's due in a day.\". If that's the case, there's a rush fee.\n\nI told her I was happy to continue working with her, provided she respected my expectations and boundaries.\n\nResult?\n\n*Drum roll...*\n\nShe disagreed on all terms, said my \"demands were ridiculous\", and we are no longer working together. \n\nShe will be paying me for the original scope, and \"not for the additional time you spent on the project\" (nearly 3 hours).\n\nShocking.\n\nApparently baseline respect for her contractor boundaries are not a part of her business model.\n\nAt the end of the day, freelancing for this person is a side gig, and I don't need her money. She grossly underpays her contractors, expects way more out of people than she pays for, so she can (to quote /u/Lysis10), eat a bag of dicks.\n\nI have my own direct clients, where I admittedly set the expectations upfront with. In that dynamic (where they're my own clients), they completely respect me and they know that from the get go.\n\nNot to mention, I make WAY more money working with my own clients vs taking on overflow for agencies. It's not even close. I compromised my time working with direct clients, for working for this asshole.\n\nBut for some reason, when taking on overflow for agencies, to me my mindset is different. They're supplying the work, they're handling the clients, so in a sense they run the show - TO AN EXTENT. \n\nI still have to setup expectations with them. And I seriously thank all of you for opening my eyes to this. I've rarely dealt with other agencies - and this was the first really bad agency I've dealt with.\n\nI've realized how easily it is, how slippery of a slope it can be.\n\nSo again - thank you so much everyone for all of your input. I've read everything and you've all helped me so much.\n\nIf you guys have any other tips at all, for working with agencies - it would be so appreciated.\n\nI actually have two other local agencies I've met with, that ironically emailed me both today and they have some projects for me. So I want to make sure everything is crystal clear from the get-go, in terms of expectations.",

I know that she’s very focussed on getting things cheap. I do great work for them, am super organised, reliable and always add value to their business.

It's clear I'm pretty good at what I do - I've had steady work the entire time, even more than I can handle most of the time. Most of my clients are really happy with my work and I love what I do.\n\nThe issue is I suffer from a couple of different mental illnesses. In the past few years I've been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder (think social anxiety on steroids) and dysthymia (lower grade depression that goes on without a break and occasionally dips into bouts of severe depression). \n\nSo I find that because of this, especially my dysthymia, my work can really suffer. During bad periods, which honestly at this point I get once every few weeks, I get very depressed which causes me to become really exhausted, and that affects my concentration. I can be sitting at my computer trying to work for 8 hours, but I might in reality get an hour of work done. The past two weeks have been a wash - I've been so down that I've gotten hardly anything done - I've been letting projects sit that really should only take me a few hours to do. Because i'm not making money it's not like i can hire someone to help me out. I just feel really stuck and I hate that I'm letting my clients down.\n\nIs there anyone who is in a similar position?

I get the bends and when I find that I’m off (can’t focus, tired, feel sluggish, upset for no good reason) I acknowledge that sitting in my chair is not going to get good work done and isn’t helping me. I take a time out and go to they gym. I like to run it out personally. I put my earphones in and run at a good pace for at least 20 mins with 5min warm up and cool down. It gets me really present, releases natural dopamine and gives, gives me more energy the next day and makes me feel like I accomplished something. Yoga also helps sometimes if Im really not in the mood to run or am physically not up to it (e.g. sore ankle or something). Other people are around but nobody really expects conversation.\n\nI also take at least one day per week for myself (usually Sunday but sometimes I’ll take Saturday instead). I tell my clients I don’t work Sundays as I need that to reset and take care of myself. Helps prevent burnout and helps me to know what day it is. \n\nSometimes just taking the dog on a walk helps me to mentally reset too. I go down to the gas station for a cookie and energy drink and when I get back I “plug in” (earphones in helps me stay focused. Pretty sure I have adult adhd and even though it works really well, I hate aderall and prefer natural ways to manage my short attention span and incessant need to not be in my chair more than 20 minutes at a time). \n\nI know you got social issues, but people aren’t meant to be alone all the time. What if you try working at a coffee shop or coworking space once every two weeks or something so you get some fresh energy from other humans? :)\n\nGlad you are coming forward for support.

I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have found my best tools for kicking through an episode are:\n\n\\--Making a specific schedule for myself ahead of time with shorter working periods rather than a vague \"I'm going to work on this all day tomorrow.\" I kind of feel like I can trick my brain into getting into gear by saying, Okay, I'm going to work on this from 9-11 tomorrow, then a break for lunch and to go buy groceries, then work on it again from 1-3, then a break to go take the dog for a walk, etc. \n\n\\--Having a dedicated workspace.  I edit and all I need is a computer, so while it's tempting to lounge in my bed, I'll go sit at my desk or head to the library or a coffee shop to reinforce in my head that I'm in work mode now, it's time to work.\n\n\\--If I've been sitting there for a while and things are going poorly, I'll take a break and doing something active--go for a quick walk, ride my bike to a coffee shop, or even just water plants in the garden.  Something to give my brain a break from hitting a brick wall.  Sometimes if I'm feeling exhausted, I'll take a nap but am sure to set an alarm so I don't sleep half the day.\n\nNone of these are totally foolproof, and I definitely still get stuck in depressive episodes, but they seem to help me when combined with medication.  I was seeing a therapist for a while until it became prohibitively expensive and that seemed to help, as well--just having an unbiased listener who I could talk to was helpful and seemed to alleviate some of the anxiety that was building up for me.\n\nGood luck, OP--I hope you find a combo of strategies that help <3",

I've helped launch several of her projects so naturally, she came back to me when they need updating, nothing major just a bit of text here and there, some image sizing, basic stuff... \n\nTorn between the prospect of losing the client and keeping her happy I completed most things.. then it got a bit relentless, realising, once again, that the small tasks are amounting to a considerable amount of time, so I followed up with a very nice email explaining how the client can benefit from paying for my services (ie.. get more of my attention, get tasks done quicker, to a higher standard, not be at the bottom of the list, etc..).\n\nI've not heard from the client since and that was 7 days ago.\n\nI'm just venting here really... but thought it may be good advice for those starting out... every second you spend with on client is worth something, bill for it, or say no.\n\nBetter clients are out there, and you won't find them if you let the shitty clients drain your time.",

Constantly update your contracts and exploratory questions.\n\nFor example, a guy recently proposed to offer me \"unlimited support\" post delivery. What on Earth does that mean? Can I call him 5 years later? Can I ask him to change a single color? I shudder to think that I'd be labeled \"a bad client\" if I asked for help until I was rebuked! What if I didn't want any support? What would the project cost then?\n\nBut yeah, learning to say no and set boundaries are the most important things a freelancer can possibly do. The best deal is often \"no deal.\" Too many people want something for nothing.",

Helps prioritize the tasks as well.\n\n2. It’s easier to charge for small tasks when they’re bulked together.\n\n3.  Increases your efficiency as you’re not constantly having to boot up the dev environment or admin panel (which does add up over the course of many small tasks). This saves the customer money, and you deliver more value for the hours billed.\n\n4. It reiterates that we do have to actually allocate time for these tasks.\n\n5. I find it a more elegant approach to open the dialogue of charging for small tasks with this proposal, rather than bluntly stating that you have to charge for such and such task.\n\nOf course, it may not be suitable for all clients but it definitely can help.",

At first it was just a pricey fee, but then they started charging the client a fee as well. The most frustrating part, is that they are completely abandoning all support. In there shareholders statements they are actually bragging about not having support.\n\nThis is so incredibly frustrating!!! I had an issue where my profile wasn’t set to the correct country and every time I changed it, it gave me an error. I could not get this fixed because no matter what I did I couldn’t get a representative to actually look at the error. I’ve made them over $20k in freelancer fees, and they aren’t even willing to spend 15 minutes to chat with me when I have an issue.\n\nI know the motto in this subreddit is to network, network, network. I get that and it’s valuable to most people. However, for some freelancers this just doesn’t work. There is probably not a single person in my city that could use my expertise. This is why I’m a big fan of Upwork, and I don’t even mind paying their fees, I just wish they actually gave a shit about their freelancers.\n\nI’m really hoping this will be the final straw that helps inspire someone else to start a better freelance website.",

This amounted to 9 grueling months of stress and frustration paired with the feeling that the project was simply going to last forever.  Just about everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. Poor scoping, poor communication, mismanagement, messy codebase, unrealistic expectations, etc. In the end the client got tired of the back and forth and decided to complete the work in house. I know that I could have just dropped off at any point, but I really just wanted to finish what I started and do it the right way. \n\nI feel like such a massive weight has been lifted. I'm finally able to dedicate more time to clients who respect my time, work, and opinion. I have the mental space to start writing music and making art again (although honestly it's taking some time to get back into the groove); to keep my house clean and organized; to go on walks without worrying about what's going to be wrong in the morning. I have the time to re-evaluate why I started freelancing to begin with, which is to avoid all of the garbage I dealt with during this project.\n\nIf you are currently dealing with a project that feels like this -- you will make it through! Whether that means taking a leap of faith and firing that horrible client or putting your head to the grindstone for 9 months and birthing a stress-based work baby, this too shall pass.\n\nKeep up the hard work everybody!

        "text": "I'm a freelance web designer/developer and I've never turned down work before, but I felt like I really had to this time. I will call this client Captain Red Flag.\n\nCaptain Red Flag called and said he was was referred to me by a very good client (always pays on time, provides all content quickly, very easy to please), who he said was his business partner. This call was FULL of red flags:\n\n* his site would be selling \"edgy\" merch in support of a very controversial political figure who I personally despise\n* said he \"had to\" fire his last developer/designer\n* said he was 6 months behind schedule and \"very frustrated\"\n* contacted me on a ***Thursday*** and said he needed the site up and running by the following ***Monday or sooner***\n* said the job would be \"easy\" and take \"very little time\" because he \"*only* needed the content and media added plus to make it all look good\"\n\nI've never seen so many red flags at once and probably should have ran screaming right then and there. However, since he is business partners with the good client, I felt like I needed to give him a chance or else risk losing the good client.\n\nAs you can probably guess, he immediately began scope creep before I even sent him the first estimate. He wanted things that would take some custom development (like a member club) and photoshopped product images in addition to everything else, PLUS keep the absurd deadline. \n\nI told him upfront the Monday deadline was never going to happen, but sent the first estimate anyway. Captain Red Flag was still interested and said I could give the final estimate once he answered some of my questions about what exactly he wanted (I now assume he thought the quote was going to go down). He proceeded to barely answer them, but I gave my best guess. I quoted about 30-45 hours of work for everything he wanted and told him my rate (below average in my area because I am usually a pushover). He balked at the cost of photoshopping images and his response to the timeline was: \"I do not believe it will take that long\" and kept reiterated that he \"only\" wanted \"simple\" things. \n\nI insisted (very nicely) that I know how long these things take, as I have other clients and have been doing this for 5+ years. He then told me he could \"save lots of time\" by adding the content himself and then I could do the custom development part---but by the way, could I tell him (for free) how to add the content?\n\nEvery conversation featured him complaining about already being over budget and being soooo frustrated. As if I am expected to work miracles and also give him a discount because he had already paid someone else. I doubted that, if I did accept him as a client, I would ever see a dime from him.\n\nWhile he was attempting to add content on his own, I decided to go ahead and pull the plug on the whole thing. I sent a very professional email thanking for him for opportunity, but told him the project was not a good fit. It's been about 24 hours, and I have not received a reply.\n\nI am tremendously relieved to have dodged this bullet, but I would hate to lose my good client over this. I haven't heard from the good client at all during this though. Should I contact them and say I appreciate the referral, but Captain Red Flag was not a good fit for my services? It was unclear, but I think the good client might even be friends with Captain Red Flag, which really concerns me. I can't figure out what the professional thing to do is.\n\nI appreciate any advice here---I have simply sucked it up and dealt with bad clients in the past, but just couldn't do it with this guy.\n\nTLDR: A very good client referred Captain Red Flag to me. The good client is a business partner with CRF (and possibly a friend), but did not speak with me at all about this project. Should I tell the good client that I appreciate the referral but that CRF is not a good fit or just leave it? I do not want to lose the good client over this.",

No response, despite the fact that they were always at their desks for emails when I did work for them.

I instantly received an email back. It basically said: \"Thanks... sorry, oversight... wish you'd picked up the phone\".\n\nI'm very junior in my role and this is fully known to this person. The implication that I've been the unreasonable one is very frustrating to say the least. Junior members of any profession should not feel reluctant to make contact to demand money they are fully entitled to and which is very late.\n\nIt's perhaps taught me a lesson of picking up the phone one more time just before sending that email.

I'll never understand why partners can't be supportive of someone's career options and abilities.\n* Setting office hours and being firm about them\n   * This is a skill in and of itself. Determine office hours and stick to them. I have a full-time job and thus only reply/work during my lunches and between 6-9pm.\n* Setting realistic expectations and managing outcomes\n   * You acknowledged that you messed up but I see no reason for you to quit if your heart and your head is still in this. One misstep doesn't equal a lifetime of failure. Chin up.\n* Learning how to sell yourself\n   * This is an essential life skill. You'll have to sell yourself for a job interview just as hard as you'll have to sell your services and their value for a client. They're one and the same: convincing someone to trust your abilities and to pay you for them.\n* Self-confidence\n   * I think this needs work above all else. Learn to stand firm, hold that chin of yours high and know what you do produces value. This will be true in your relationships both professionally and personally. You not only keep people around you, but they keep you around as well. Without confidence in one, the other can't exist. You had one client. Don't let that one person in a world of 7 billion tell you that you're worthless when you made a mistake that's happened to many of us.",

Lots of small businesses and startups can't afford typical agency/freelancer rates and many are perfectly happy with things we would say are low standard, and there are people who are either willing to produce that work, or need the practice so it works fine.\n\nOnce you've got enough experience and enough clients though, they become totally worthless. Let the bottom feeders stay where they are and start working your way up.\n\nI find most of my work through 2 ways: Bigger agencies/freelancers, and Google ads. With bigger agencies, they'll take me on for a few days when they have a bit of overflow. It's not regular but if you build a big enough list of clients it can be stable enough. They won't argue about pay because they're used to it, and they tend to be better to work with because they understand what you do and can offer good feedback. With Google ads, I'm basically getting the same people I would find through Upwork et. al. but they come to me and I immediately have a connection with them - direct emails or even phone calls. Rather than having to pitch I just have to charm them, and it just so happens I've got the gift of the gab.",

Most people know when they are procrastinating, and if you do it too much the world will come around and tell you to stop.

It isn't obvious when it's happening, and it's really hard to know just how much to correct for it. We are taught shame and guilt for *not* undercharging, and when we have failures due to undercharging we often blame them on other things (Taxes are too high! I just can't make ends meet! There aren't enough hours in a day. ) \n\nEven worse, sometimes we blame undercharging on *overcharging*... \"I haven't had a client in two weeks and I'm running out of money\". If your charging a reasonable rate for freelancing, it should provide you with enough cash for the inevitable, but occasional, dry spell. \n\nNo, Procrastination is *a* problem.

Mention that you've decided your business will be moving in a different direction toward more full, comprehensive services and that you are no longer able to commit to the services requested. Tell them what you're most interested in now (or projects that will bring in the most for you), and ask them if they or anyone they know are interested. If desired and the client is local, offer to take them out for coffee.\n\nThis will typically work and be a 21-gun send-off that makes you look like a hero. If, per chance, they are more than willing to be part of these new services and they're harder to shake off: treat them like a new client. Use your new rate, include contracts/language that deter them from poor practices and don't be afraid to treat them like the new direction you're headed in. \"So sorry, I know this is something we've gotten used to over history, but service methods have since had to change for efficiency to offer clients the best rate - if this is still preferred, I'm able to offer this additionally for $x\".\n\nI think this manages to incorporate bridge-building while also tackling their bad habits while potentially keeping them as a client in the worst-case and earning the most amount of money off of them for their troubles, should they not be willing to adapt to a new system. That said, I wouldn't encourage nickel and diming them for everything; if it's as bad as you say simply turning them down is the most honest and best way and can even be something related to clawing back on your schedule from overworking yourself.",

I have no friends or close family to reach out to (because of my social anxiety) and I just dont really know anyone other than my gf on a personal level.\n\nI tried reaching out to businesses through email and facebook, but I think I am just coming across as spam. I also tried reaching out to other developers to see if they would like to work together, even on just side projects because I want to get more experience working within a team rather than just solo. But I never get a response.\n\nI know I could try cold calling people but I really hate doing this, and I suspect business owners also do not appreciate it.\n\nSo it seems like I should look around locally and meet business owners in person and try to set up a meeting. I dont like the idea, but it seems like its what I have to do. Unfortunately I live in a rural area and do not have a car, so thats also a challenge.\n\nAfter freelancing for 8 months, it seems that dealing with shitty clients, total lack of job security, and having to rely on being able to sell myself, has only made my anxiety and depression much worse. \n\nSo as of right now I have gone back to [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com), but I am only applying to jobs that are worth my time. No more of this \"Ill work for cheap so I can build a portfolio\" crap. I want (need) the higher paying jobs. In the mean time I think I will look for manual labour part time so that I have some type of income security. I am also applying to local and remote webdev jobs as an employee, but its difficult. I do not feel confident in my abilities at all, and I feel like, as soon as I have an interview, I will just have a panic attack.\n\ni am looking to get help though. I plan to go to a clinic today with the hope of getting a prescription for, or learning about, anti depressants or some other medication (cant aford therapy though).\n\nI have also started attending a local group with other computer science enthusiasts. This has actually made me feel both better and worse about myself. Worse about my comp-sci abilities because I barely understand half of what they are talking about (just smile and nod), but better because I know I am in a place that will help me grow.\n\nTLDR:\n\nWeb development was suggested as a good job for people with social anxiety, but I think working as a freelancer was a terrible choice. It only made my anxiety and depression worse because I was isolated. ",

I'm a web developer for x (create your own company name), I've seen opportunities in your business for x and was wondering if you were interested in meeting me at your convenience if you find my service would be a positive investment in your future?\"\n\nPolite introduction, value highlight, call to action and response. This gives you an opportunity to send samples/references or book a time for a meeting where you can meet.\n\n>After freelancing for 8 months, it seems that dealing with shitty clients, total lack of job security, and having to rely on being able to sell myself, has only made my anxiety and depression much worse.\n\nYou've just described most freelancing. You're normal. Freelancing is difficult and stressful as you not only take on that piece of the industry you enjoy/excel at, but business interactions as well - all while trying to earn a living to keep the lights on.\n\nBack to work via [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com):\n\nThis is a great opportunity to gather reviews and testimonials from clients you do work on and passively build your portfolio. Build up a boilerplate email/summary that you can customize and request these sorts of references for each project. This way you not only remember to each project, but can reach out in a way that will feel increasingly standard and *casual,* hopefully tackling your anxiety.\n\nWith regards to anxiety, you hit briefly on close family - have they departed? Are you not on speaking terms with them? Obviously a few trips to McDonalds won't solve your social anxieties but every public interaction where you can go out and socialize is important. Start by ordering a meal. Follow up by asking how they are today. It's short, it feels silly but this is socializing. No one is staring at you. You won't become a story of 'that weirdo during my shift'. Just speak to people politely and ask (a few, limited) questions. That's a common key to sounding engaged and polite. A simple how are you can give someone a break from their stressful day and satisfy your need to socialize. You have a girlfriend, you're clearly farther along than you give credit for. Does she have friends? Perhaps you can go out for a couples dinner or very casual event like the movies? It's all socialization! Engage in online communities, hop on voice chat with people you don't know and who don't know you. Being anonymous gives you the opportunity to \"make mistakes\" (even though no one else will see or recognize them, the mistakes are all simply internal and feel like the end of the world). Practice. Practice. No one's watching you. Practice.\n\nGood luck and smile. Not all therapy needs to be a paid, directed experience. We live in an age of access and information, but also community. Find an interest and talk to people about it.",

Should I do it?\n\nLong story long:\nA little back story. I'm a web developer. I've had this client for over seven years. Over time they've become my largest client, as I've built and now maintain a large array of systems for them. Every year, I increase my rate by a nominal amount. Over time that rate increase has put me I a bit awkward position, as I now depend on their work to makes-up a large amount of my revenue. Recently their business has been struggling and they are looking to save money. They're asking me to write-up detailed step-by-step instructions on how to update and maintain all the systems I've implemented for them. It's becoming obvious they are looking to replace me and would like the new company/person to have a seamless takeover of my current work.\nNot sure what to do, as losing them is going to kill my business. But, it also looks like they're not going to be able afford me either. Should I just write the instructions, or just try to work-out a new deal with them?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for all the advice! These replies have been a wealth of information and ideas. I’ve decide to choose the route of providing a vague list of instructions and propose to consult for a period of time to transition the new person/company who is taking over. I figure it will be good to have them as a reference as well as gain the consulting experience. Hopefully they will go for it. The consulting would be for a couple months which will give me time to either gain new clients or look at new opportunities. I do receive a couple job offers a year just through friends and friends-of-friends, so I may just close shop and try that if the gaining new clients doesn’t pan-out.",

That kills any chance of them ever working with you again. You also aren't helping yourself long-term if you temporarily cut rates - you're just delaying the inevitable and resetting expectations down. The best thing you can do is make the transition as painless as possible for the client and be so damn professional that they worry they are making a huge mistake. If the experience with the new team sucks, you'll be the first they call if money was the only issue and the relationship ended on a good note.\n\nWhat I would offer up is a 3 month 'transition' package to them once they officially give the news. Tell them you'll bundle [x] hours of consulting time per month to get the new team up to speed as your workload dials back. This lets you pass on the historic knowledge and lets the other team get up to speed - and also gives you some money runway why you go and pitch newbiz.",

That's actually fairly cheap. \n\nSwitch to Stripe or similar if you want to still allow CC payments, but that will be 2.9% + $0.30 - ~~more expensive~~ about the same cost.\n\nEdit: you can also get into the territory of ACH, but that will limit the options your customers have to pay.\n\nIf you don't want service fees, have them cut a check.  But then your payment will be delayed by a much longer amount of time in the best case scenarios.\n\nOtherwise, money transference is a regulated industry.  You're paying for a service.  Factor that overhead into your pricing.",

        "text": "Over 5 years of working as a freelance web developer and SEO, I’ve dealt with my fair share of “clients from hell.” I see these stories posted on this subreddit all the time.\n\nThe turning point in my career was the realization that I actually helped enable some of these horrible clients and projects. In many situations, I was just dealing with an inexperienced client and I took on the role of \"contract employee\" when I actually needed to be a consultant and project manager.\n\nHere's an example of a situation where I was able to identify and avoid a toxic relationship during the initial stages of a project:\n\n## Identifying a bad relationship\n\nAt one point in my career, a prospect selected me to handle a seemingly simple web development project with a fixed price.\n\n\nHe gave me a general idea of what he wanted — a simple theme based on another website — and requested that we get started immediately after signing a simple workers agreement.\n\n### Not so fast…\n\nThe obvious problem with this situation is that there wasn’t a clear scope of work. As a consultant, it was my job to work with the client to define the precise scope of work and **agree on the definition of success.**\n\nThis meant that *“I want a website similar to these 4 websites”* wasn’t enough information to estimate the scope of work.\n\n## Precisely defining success\n\nI’ve had several projects, that began with a vague scope of work, drag on because I was at the mercy of the client to define what qualifies as a completed project.\n\n**A client might take advantage of ambiguity to lock you into completing additional requests.**\n\nFor example, “develop a landing page” might appear like a simple development and copywriting job, but the client might claim that you obviously should also set up A/B testing, heatmaps, or even a multi-step, integrated submission form because “that’s what any competent web developer would do.”\n\n> Yes, I’ve actually had clients make these kinds of assumptions and then attempt to pressure me into the extra work by insulting my experience-level.\n\n**Since you’re so far through the project and want to get paid, you’ll likely do the extra work to avoid friction.**\n\nIn my situation, I managed to grill the client until I got the exact scope of work.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the number of pages went from 5 to 25, with 3 unique template designs, one landing page with third-party integrations, pop ups with varying actions, and a custom, on-page equity calculator.\n\nThe client specifically requested help “creating a website theme,” but after uncovering the actual scope of work, it was clear that I would have been doing much more.\n\nAlthough the scope of work essentially doubled, I realized that the client would have asked for these tasks to be completed anyway. \n\nDuring our discussion, it became clear that the client assumed some tasks were easy and would take “like 30 minutes.” Although this might just seem like plain ignorance, **this behavior indicates that the client won’t value the work.**\n\nAfter adjusting the scope of work, the timeline, and doubling the project estimate, it was clear that the client would look for a cheaper alternative.\n\n## A mutually beneficial relationship\n\nClients benefit from selecting contractors who work with the client to define success and lay out a properly formulated project road map. A client can then identify competent contractors and avoid working with freelancers who over promise and under deliver. ",

        "text": "Hi freelancing friends!\n\nI am a digital marketer and just brought on a new agency client about 4 months ago. It was intended to bring me some stability as I worked on personal projects and it has been the complete opposite. \n\nThe work is fairly easy but comes in small parts constantly and is generally annoying. Lots of micromanaging. They don’t respect my turnaround times and want everything urgent, question my invoices, and have even paid late.\n\nI’ve had conversations about my turnaround time, urgent billing, my work process with them but it sticks for a minute and then there’s always somehow an exception to the rule. Ultimately, I don’t think we’re a good fit and they need an employee in the role.\n\nMeanwhile, they’ve been brewing up web projects dependent on my work for 2020 and I’m feeling at the end of my rope with them. They have signed my agreement, but I have no standing contract on their side of how long our relationship should last. I have a 30 days written notice for termination clause that I would be willing to honor if they are into it.\n\nFinancially it would be a hit but I could handle it and with my sanity on the line, that means more than the 30 days later check I get from these folks.\n\nAm I a huge asshole if I pull out now while these projects are being pitched to clients? Am I ridiculous for making the poor business practice of relying completely on a freelancer my problem? Turning to my fellow freelancers for some bravery on how to deal with this.\n\nUPDATE: Due to personal/pandemic reasons it took me until June to fire this client but they are now gone and I am so relieved!!",

Things were fine for two months, then they were late on another payment. I refereed to the previous email and fired them (very nicely of course).

If there are no consequences for disrespecting your terms, they're not terms at all.\n\nSince they have disrespected you in the past despite warnings and direct conversations, I'd just make sure there isn't anything in your contract that would allow them to screw you over. If you get paid through PayPal, maybe send your funds to your bank account (I know PayPal started this thing where they request a refund, but I've heard of cases where they let clients win disputes without much notice to the seller).\n\nGood luck!",

That's fair, if that's the case. And if it *is* the case, then feel no remorse about ending the contract.\n\nYou should also be aware that if you have the \"I might terminate\" conversation, then they may very well change things and keep you on only long enough to find someone else. If you're ready to end it anyway, this shouldn't be too big a concern, but is something you should be aware of and prepared for.",

        "text": "Hi all, apologies if this is the wrong place for this or has been asked before (though I couldn't find it).\n\nI had a really bad \"mental health week\" a couple of weeks ago. Basically, I had some work to do that probably should have taken two or three days, but I got into a depressive funk and frittered my time away, procrastinating. In the end, it wound up taking about a week and a half. \n\nI'm working for a woman I've worked for before and have a good relationship with. She's extremely nice, didn't even ask for progress updates, and since she's busy with other projects I can't tell if she didn't notice or just doesn't want to say anything. Regardless, I don't want to take advantage, so I'm trying to figure out how to explain that I'm going to invoice her for less time.\n\nI've since gotten out of the funk and picked up the pace. Luckily we have another two weeks to finish this thing, but I may be able to finish it in just a few days. I also worked a bit over the weekend to make up for the lost time.\n\nAlthough I've had trouble in the past with procrastinating at home, it's never been this bad, so I've never been in this situation before. It's been much worse lately because I've been working from home for a year straight, whereas I usually have gigs mostly outside my home. I'm pretty social and talkative so I hate working from home for long stretches of time. \n\nPart of me wants to be honest about what happened, but I've been told that I should just keep it vague and say that some personal or family issues came up. I don't want to lie, but I wonder if that would be more professional? The woman I'm working for also had a death in her family recently, and she was honest about it, but it doesn't seem to have slowed her down at all, so I feel kind of silly for bringing up my issues. \n\nWhat do you guys think? What would you say in this situation?",

It has not helped me to tell a client essentially, \"this week sucked, I'll do better next time.\" You do have a rapport to keep up and they do want to see you as a reliable, unflappable resource. You may be pantsless and on a chocolate cookie bender covered in cats; so long as you're delivering, in their mind's eye you may as well be poised to start another big project for them.

I just want the work to be good and complete.  So I wouldn't share anything more unless she is asking for an explanation.  She likely doesn't even see it as an issue.\n\nRe: lowering the invoice:\n\nI don't know how your contracts are structured, but I bill for the hours I spend actively working on the project regardless of how much calendar time has elapsed (if it is an hourly contract), so the days of funk/procrastinating wouldn't change how much the work costs.   \n\nIf you are talking about lowering the invoice as an apology for missing a deadline, that is your call whether to do that, but I would just say \"I gave you a discount of x because this took me longer than I think it should have taken.\"   But I wouldn't do that unless you really feel the delay has burdened her in some way.\n\nIf your client shows any concern and asks you what's going on, I think it's fine to be honest.  I am just saying don't go out of your way to point it out when she isn't even seeing it as an issue.",

I have message the associate (as I doubt I will be able to get into contact with the original client) pretty much saying these points:- I got a notification saying that you disabled manual-time on our project- I have always exclusively worked with manual-time and have never had an issue with any of my clients- Due to a few reasons, I do not use the Time Tracker- Request to switch back to manual-time or discuss things further\n\nI expect to hear a response from him tomorrow, to which i will be updating this for all of you to see.

Good, well-funded clients won't balk at your rate if your work is quality.",

        "text": "Last month I decided to try working a 4 day week and try to build some space into my working routine for downtime. I've tried before to take time off but it never works out, so in March I thought trying to timetable time away from work.\n\nI'm a graphic designer so the main purpose is to do some lino and etching printing and try to be creative without feeling the need to make it pay. Just do it for fun. I also want to catch up with friends and go for long walks etc, to get away from the screens and have some personal time. I've been feeling pretty stressed after a very hectic 2018 and want to try and reduce burnout.\n\nI decided Thursdays are to be my 'personal development' days. I would work 8:30 to 6 the other days with the option of working later on the Wednesday if needed.\n\n\\- Did I take time off? Managed to take Thursdays off in Weeks 1,2 and 4.  Week 3 went a bit wrong when I had a client call up to see if I was free Tuesday to Friday for a project.  Couldn't turn it down, but other than that 3 out of 4 days wasn't bad.\n\n\\- Did I get enough done? I feel like I still managed to get all by projects done in 4 days.  I didn't miss any deadlines. There are a few 'lesser' clients I have had to say I don't have time for, but they don't seem to be going anywhere.\n\n\\- Did it help?  I think so.  I'm not sure I feel more relaxed, but I guess just one month is not enough time to judge.\n\n\\- Did I actually do any printing? No, but I have done some sketches and started cutting some lino.\n\n\\- Will I stop asking myself questions on Reddit and get on with some work?  Bah....",

Cheers all! \n\nMy post:\n\nMy website went live 2 weeks ago and I thought I was ready to be the best freelancer that ever there was. I’ve got 2 clients in 2 weeks and I am already struggling. \n\nMaking mistakes with pricing. Agreeing to too much. Letting them dictate the price. Not forming contracts. Replying to emails well into the evening. Not telling my client that I don’t want to communicate through WhatsApp or have them add me on social media. Not enforcing that reworks cost money. Being ghosted by potential clients. Listening to potential clients bitch their previous designers and their prices in the hope that I will bend over backwards to be different.

        "text": "This is merely a rant and not much I can do about it except move on, but here's to getting it off my chest. Just got fired from a freelance job and it's a complete mystery to me as to why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been freelancing to cover the bills for the sake of working on my own projects this year. I'm a software developer with a focus on front-end development and have worked mostly with WordPress and Drupal, making larger-scale applications. I have over 10 years of experience in making software/websites. I get in with this staffing agency and they love my work and get me a job for a few days a week, starting the very next week. I have to go into an office, and the job itself is basically fixing bugs in their current work and coding HTML emails...really, really low-level things compared to my current skill set that I could do asleep. jQuery fixes, small CSS fixes. The websites they're working on are all in WordPress, not using SCSS or anything like that, really basic stuff. There's no React or anything like that utilizing my full potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI start on a Thursday at 1pm, by EOD Friday they're telling me how impressed they are with how good my work is, and how quick I am to figure out problems. No brainer, I've coded more HTML emails than I can count and have been doing jQuery literally since it was released. Friday they tell me they like me enough that they want to bring me in M-F the next week rather than the initial agreed upon 2 days per week. Cool! I want the cash, the team is fantastic, the work is easy, always good to build a network, etc. Monday comes, the PM comes up to me and tells me they really like me so much that they'd like to interview me for a full-time position. I agree. The work week continues, I code up several emails which get approved. I do a few websites' edits and get everything done each day I'm given the task. A few QA items here or there, none that I didn't get to or anything major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo into the formal interview on Thursday, it goes well. Get a call from the recruiter at the staffing agency the next day and hear it sounds like they really like me. Zero red flags. EOD this next Friday, we discuss my schedule for the next week, and I'm told we were still waiting on some mockups from designers, so my schedule was to be Tuesday/Wednesday. I had gotten all the work that was given to me done AND approved, asked for more, and they didn't have any more to give me by EOD Friday. A very normal, positive conversation about next weeks to-dos was the last conversation I had with the PM at about 4:40 pm Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, Monday comes (don't have to go in) and I get a call from the recruiter of the staffing agency. She says something about files being in the trash versus the server and it was something the PM was going to talk to me about tomorrow. I said ok, sure, perhaps something I'm not understanding about their process...but the 'things in the trash' was a bit concerning. Why were they going through the trash on the computer? I clear off my desktop at the end of the week from any temp files I was working on that were on my desktop, but everything was in Mailchimp, on their asset server, on their external server, and/or in the repo that I had been working on. What I threw into the trash were what was on the Desktop in their working state. Then, at 5:30 yesterday, I get a somber-sounding email from the staffing agency that my employment was ceased immediately with no explanation. I emailed back asking if it was a change in their needs, or if something else was wrong because the incredibly short notice and tone of the email was fishy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe staffing agency recruiter calls me back the next day to tell me that the team had to redo all of my work and that they felt it was pointless therefore to have me on as a freelancer. Literally, everything I had done was sent out to the test list and approved by multiple people. Approved, done--entire campaigns sent, where I was told, 'Looks like that got sent out and everything looked good, thanks!' Website edits I had done had been deployed successfully. Having to redo my work makes no sense, I had nothing in the QA phase. By EOD Friday I was done with everything, sitting there asking for more work, and they had no QA items for me or feedback. This type of work was so remarkably low-level from a technical standpoint I'm baffled so I genuinely don't think its that I did poorly with the work itself. It was like a McDonald's job compared to my actual skill set. Worst of all, they shared this with the staffing agency, where this was the first gig they got me, that I can't fucking handle making HTML emails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The emails were responsive\n\n\\- The emails were cross-client tested in Litmus\n\n\\- The emails were retina-ready\n\n\\- The emails were sent out to a test internally and to the client, minimal feedback (changing dash to endash, typo in the mockup, etc.). The feedback I received was done promptly and every single email I received was approved\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe end feedback was a complete 180 from what I had been told directly just 1 business day prior. Perhaps a bad designer I hadn't met was having a bad day? Perhaps they lost some files and blamed me? Perhaps I put a file in the incorrect spot and they fired me immediately instead of asking me where I put it? I'm clueless. I've never been fired from a job so I was pretty upset, and it really sucks that it has ruined my reputation with a staffing agency I just got hired on with. The staffing agency doesn't seem to respect me anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Unrelated..but just to note, in response to multiple comments, I am a woman, not a man. Not all programmers are men. Ok, sorry, it's been a hard day. End edit.",

        "text": "I had read horror stories about how toptal interviewers intentionally fail applicants to keep their competition pool small, but I decided to give it a shot anyways out of curiousity.\n\nI'm an experienced developer, 15 years working full time.  I decided to pursue only the SQL developemnt at Toptal as it's my strongest skill and I've always been the subject matter expert at each place I worked.\n\nThe first thing I noted about the interviewers is that they all appear to be very poor, none of them I spoke to were from the US, if there were I'd guess they are making ~$200-$300/week.  The first interviewer who did the english speaking portion, was friendly enough but seemed to have a hard time with the English language himself.  \n\nThe second interviewer who held the title \"Senior Software Engineer\" appeared to be extremely poor in the way he dressed and the background of the video chat.  By that I mean there was obvious filth on the walls and he was using old iphone earbuds for the conference.  His english was extremely hard to understand and his grammar made it very difficult to understand what he was meaning.  His lack of appropriate audio communication equipment also made it difficult to understand him.  He started the interview by asking me if my \"test environment\" is ready, I told him I have no idea what he is talking about.  I emailed him the day before asking what I need set up for the test and he did not reply.  Once he confirmed that I did email him, he agreed to reschedule the interview.\n\nOn to the actual technical interview, which is as far as I got.  The interview was to start at 8:00pm my time(CST), it was the only time available that day.  He logged on at 8:05 and told me it will be 3 minutes, then he logged on again and started the meeting at 8:10pm.  The 3 questions he posted were realtively simple and I moved through them quickly.  The final question was to be completed in 20 minutes and in my oppinion is impossible without cheating or being \"prepared\": \n\nThe final question was to create 5 related tables (he provided some logical field names) with referential integrity.  Then you are to populate the tables with sample data.  Then you are to write 3 specific semi-complex queries using the data...all in 20 minutes.  I've been doing this for years and nobody could pull that off.\n\nMy guess is that this final question is what they throw out if they want to fail you.  In any case, I wished him well, then a few minutes later I received an email from him that contained the line \"Unfortunately, your current skills are not in line with what we require from our talents\".  That did make me chuckle a little.\n\nSo, the reason I'm posting this is to let anyone interested in actually working there that you should be prepared that it will disapoint you.  From what I researched, even if you get in the pay is very low, which is proven by the interviewers living in such poor conditions.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ideally, clients are going to you.\n\nI now know what it's like to be a freelancer, and have a better understanding of freelancing vs full time jobs.\n\nIt's not something you can learn by reading, it's something that must be experienced.

However when it comes time to provide their content they either take forever to write anything or they'll start saying \"Oh can we just scrap this part of the website? Do we really need it?\"\n\nIt's annoying that many times I'll say \"This page needs 2-3 paragraphs of text. Can you send it through?\" And they comeback and barely manage to write a few lines. One of the more bizarre instances is when I asked a client for content for their pages and during a meetup they came in with a pile of random bits of paper and said \"Ok. So I got this bit from Wikipedia and I got this from this other site about ...\" \n\nI just sat there for a few moments and then said \"No. What I need is for you to write out your own content for your pages and then send it to me in a digital format like an email. I can't write your content for you from a bunch of printed off webpages.\" \n\n",

Most business owners can answer the question over the phone (tell me about the topic of this page) it's just writing it where they struggle. So yes, very common and frustrating!",

Let's say you double your rates, suddenly you only need to work half the time to make the same amount of money. Now you have time to live your life and take care of yourself. You'll also probably have better quality clients, so some of the stress from work will be relieved. \n\nIf it sounds impossible to increase your rates, then you either know that you're not good enough at the service you're offering or you are holding too tightly to the \"security\" of having all that work to do. Try it for two weeks and see if you can decrease some of your time spent working. If you don't have any change, then you just might not be cut out for freelancing. But most people tend to sell themselves short and charge abysmally low rates. If you can't charge at least $35/hr. for what you're doing, you need to reevaluate some things, because with taxes and expenses, you need to charge at least that much to bring in minimum wage profit.",

You aren’t their employee. You have control over your time.\n\n* raise your rates and squash the doubt that you won’t find clients that will pay you the higher rate (you will) or that you won’t find work\n\n* learn to say no in different ways. You may be letting your clients take control of your time. It’s *up to you* how you manage your time. They only pay for the end result. Otherwise they should be paying your taxes as a W9.\n\n* believe that you have a ladder of progression that _you_ can reach. Yes you could make $100/hr and work 15 hours a week. That’s *up to you* to make it there.\n\n* believe that you can have a balanced lifestyle and make changes *today* no matter how small they all. They will compound over time. If you take one small step every day, in a year you would have taken 365 steps towards a better lifestyle.\n\n* might sound cliché but tell yourself “I can do it”. Mindset will get you where you want to be. Expect crappy days, but move towards overall positive progress.\n\n* leave the house regularly and do something that you like. Ideally do something that’s not what you do for freelancing. Just helps to disconnect and recharge a bit.\n\n* buy some weights and put them next to your bed. Do some weights every day. You’d be amazed at what just a few minutes of weight training can do to your emotional well-being just because of the endorphins your body releases.\n\nI’ve written a good amount about freelancing here so visit my profile for more.",

She's suffering from a problem where she's constantly worried about her work, just as she wakes up, during meals, during commutes, before she sleeps, almost all the time. For instance the other night before she went to bed she remembered that she forgot to send a reminder to one of her customers. Stress is building up and it's not looking good for her mental health.\n\nI think this is probably a personal organization problem, if she can set up a system so she can figuratively leave all her work on her computer (or at least phone), she can alleviate some of this anxiety. Maybe a combination of apps can help.\n\nIf anyone can suggest any tools or ideas it would be greatly appreciated\n\nP.S. she is on the apple ecosystem \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for the overwhelming number of responses, really grateful for the feedback and a lot of them are very helpful. Just wanted to know if anyone has any apps to suggest? I’m not familiar with the scene but I keep hearing good things about apps like Evernote, omnifocus, etc. Does anyone have a specific app to recommend? Again thanks for the overwhelming response ",

I'd be stressed too if I worked a 16-hour day and as those days pile on, one tends to miss things.\n\nSet standard office hours. Organize tasks. Set reminders. Keep to your office hours and do not answer correspondence during off-hours (no worth-while client is going to otherwise dump you because they had to wait 14 hours for a response between 6pm-8am). She may benefit too from dedicated task schedules such as 9am-10am: correspondence. 10am-12pm: client work.",

Part of me wants you to give her the space to get those grinds done, because they are very important in the long run. Every hour spent now could result in month long repeat gigs in the future. That said, there are certainly limits where you should calm down a bit, and when it gets in the way of relationships, it becomes more of a relationship issue rather than a work one I think. Maybe the both of you sit down and set some work boundaries. That way, she has the time to work and you have the peace of mind that you're not going to get the worst of her.\n\nNext to that, here's some tips:\n\nEmails 3 times a day, no more. Morning, Noon, Evening. Even two times a day is fine, if like myself, you work on long gigs which don't need immediate contact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWriting out a list for the next day the NIGHT BEFORE and sticking to it. Make the top of the list the priority and get that stuff done in the morning, everything else can wait until the next day if something needs to get added. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs well as the above, use a calendar app to plan days for each projects at the beginning of each week. This takes 5 minutes to do (I use google calendar as it syncs with my email and phone). Then during the week, keep it updated with any new work that comes in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLog hours. I use a simple spreadsheet system that accounts for per project, then at the end of each quarter, i'll log each project in my master spreadsheet which can break down the projects and how long I spend on each part of the project. From editing, planning, to face to face correspondence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven using a separate web browser for work vs play is one way of tackling it, if you can't afford a spare room or PC to work on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could also recommend a book called 'Eat That Frog'. It kicked my arse into gear when I first started freelance, and allowed me the headspace to start working better on what is actually important. I could bet that she could save at least an hour or two each day just saying no to what she has to do and she will lose nothing.",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nAbout 9 months ago (Feb 2019) I started looking into Fiverr as an option to make some extra money online. I posted my first gig with the goal of being able to make $100-$200 extra per month. Since February I've made $11,000, completed 133 projects, and my hourly rate is over $150/hour. My focus area on Fiverr is any job related to writing (email writing, copywriting, website pages, amazon product descriptions, linkedin messages, I'll write anything really). \n\nFiverr has become a huge source of income for me. And I've noticed that since starting I've become pretty good at ranking my gigs higher, negotiating higher prices with buyers, and streamlining my workflow so that I'm delivering gigs in shorter periods of time (resulting in a higher $/h than when I started). \n\nI figured this would be helpful information to share with anyone else who might want to use Fiverr as a great method to make money online. So, I decided to put together a series of videos that breaks down every step I took to growing my business on Fiverr, and getting to the point where I'm making over $150/h selling on Fiverr. \n\nLink to videos:  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7os4pDGawza5q8nnQmgDOPApCQvRYQbs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7os4pDGawza5q8nnQmgDOPApCQvRYQbs) \n\nSo far there are 9 videos and I have a backlog of an additional 10 planned videos that I think would helpful to anyone who is interested in getting better at selling on fiverr. I'm working on getting them all posted asap. \n\nMy goal is that these videos are helpful for anyone already selling or who wants to start selling on fiverr. I really think there is a huge opportunity to make some good money on Fiverr (especially given that they've recently IPO'd... I think that indicates that the company is going to be spending quite a bit of money on marketing which will help drive buyers to sellers on fiverr).\n\nAnyways, enjoy!",

We've pretty much all grown out of the idea of \"common sense\" and people are starting to become aware that different life experience yields different skill sets. Honest, helpful resources like this are so necessary.\n\nAs a rhetorician, I have one suggestion: \nSome of the language is harsh. I'm sure it's there for humor, but be careful making your target audience the punchline of any joke.\n\nEx. \"Many of these should be obvious, but based on personal experience, ya’ll need some help.\"\n\nThis reads like a brotherly nudge to some, but could be divisive and prematurely shut down your effort in the eyes of the audience that actually does need it most. \n\nColloquialisms can bring down the language level and make a piece more inviting but it can also do a disservice to the ethos/credibility of the piece. This will sound classist, but I recommend that you don't use \"y'all.\" The word is fine. It's commonly accepted language. It's just a little dicey when it comes to a technical piece meant to reach a broad audience.\n\nSome other instances like \"if any of you want to function in today's world, you need a job\" (paraphrased) should be changed to just address a singular audience. Avoid making is readers feel like we're in a bootcamp. If that means \"babying\" us millennials, then so be it.\n\nOtherwise great job and thanks for spending time on this. I'm working on something similar in spirit in hopes of helping some lost folks and this is great inspiration.",

Searching \"how to make money online\" usually results in sponsored articles, overly complicated information or methods that just don't make sense to your situation.\n\nI wanted to make a super friendly website that will allow ANYONE to find ways to make money online as easily as possible. I programmed an advanced filtering system, allowing to sort methods according to how profitable they are or even how passive they are, filter out methods that don't pay with PayPal, show only methods that are available worldwide, and more! And to provide the simplest guides, I created [step-by-step.io](https://step-by-step.io/?ref=workonline), as a sister website to Income Rankings that collects the easiest step-by-step guides for each method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo far there are 15 methods on Income Rankings, and only a handful of voters, but I'm hoping those numbers will increase with your help. :)\n\nLet's build the best place for people to come to when they need to or are looking for earning income online!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n👉 [https://incomerankings.com](https://incomerankings.com/?ref=workonline)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also possible to submit methods with your referral links which will allow you to earn money by submitting! As I also need to 🍽️ eat I ask for $25/m to promote your referral link / website on Income Rankings. If you're interested in promoting your referral links on the current listed methods, that's possible too. Just send me a message!\n\nI'm planning on improving and adding many things in the near future, such as allowing voting on more data, community reviews / tips for each method, pubic profiles for online earners, chat rooms for each method and more! Of course I'd be happy to hear your feedback, advice and suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks! -Theo",

Payments are made through check, bank deposit or PayPal on a weekly basis.\n\nThe project will last until November 2019, if there are no delays in development. You are required to work atleast 2 hours per week, if you fail to meet that goal you will lose access to our system. You can work as many hours as you like, more is encouraged as someone who plays the game a lot also will have a better understanding of it and by that logic also provide better feedback.\n\nFor testing on the PC/Mac platform you do not need a very high end PC, something along the lines of an i3 cpu and a Radeon HD 6950 gfx is more than enough for our lowest settings.\n\nFor the next step, you need to sign up on our partner site we use for this testing job. We have a contractual obligation towards them to go through their channels when we hire testers. Their signup however requires you to pay $1 for a 7 day trial, this will be reimbursed to you the day after you sign up. When you're signed up, find the \"jobs\" tab and search for \"Paradox Interactive\", click on \"Apply\" and provide your Reddit username and you will be accepted within 24 hours.\n\nLink: http://gamingjobs.promoreservoir.com\n\nThe job starts as soon as you've been accepted on the platform. There are no hours and you can work whenever you like.\n\nLooking forward to working with you!\n\nRegards\n\nLike I literally laughed my ass off when I saw this.",

After reading one particular book that was great except for some glaring grammatical and typo errors, I emailed the publisher with points I felt could be reviewed.\n\nHe texted me back, and asked for my resume, etc. Now truthfully my editing experience is based on my love of books, but I have helped my kids with their college essays. So I ripped a book into Word (oops,I won't ever do that again! It's illegal and I didn't have any malicious intent behind it), and fully edited the book, as well as sending him my resume.\n\nLong story short, I had a one month probationary period, and now I have a permanent job.",

        "text": "If you don't know what Online transcription is, it's the procedure of converting Audio to text. The job expects you to listen to some audio streams and convert them to text as accurately as possible. So basically you need to be a good listener and have fast typing skills to become a successful transcriber.\n\nGood news is, I am going to share a list of 10 platforms where you can apply as a Freelance Transcriber and and work according to your own schedule:\n\n* **TranscribeMe.com**: One of the most popular online transcription platforms. If you have expertise in legal or medical transcription then you can easily earn $22 per hour. Payment method is **Paypal**.\n* **Rev.com**: Rev pays $2 to $30 per audio hour based on your experience. They pay weekly via **Paypal**.\n* **GoTranscript.com**: GoTranscript pays you up to $0.60 per audio minute. They hire workers worldwide. Average monthly earnings are around $125. They pay via **Paypal**.\n* **SpeakWrite.com**: They are currently hiring in USA and Canada. They also require you to have a decent typing speed. Average monthly earnings are reported to be around $450. They pay via **Check** or **Direct Deposit**.\n* **SpeechPad.com**: The average transcriber pay rate start from $0.25 to $2.50 per minute. Payments are made twice a week. Payment method is **Paypal**.\n* **Scribie.com**: Their average audio pay rate is $5 to $25 per hour based on experience. They usually have short audio files to work on (10 minutes or less). You can also get monthly bonuses. They pay via **Paypal**.\n* **Transcribe.com**: They only offer jobs to US residents. You will have to go through an assessment before you get hired. Payment rates vary with tasks. Payments are made via **Paypal**.\n* **WeLocalize.com**: WeLocalize pays you to transcribe songs and lyrics. They have a fixed pay rate of $4 per song. Payments are made through **ACH** and **Wire Transfer**.\n* **Audio Transcription Center**: You get paid to transcribe History interviews, financial forecasts, tech webinars etc. They pay on weekly basis.\n* **Nibity.com**: As a worker, you will have to transcribe 30 to 60 minutes of audio on daily basis.

                "text": "A kind of important point that this post elides is that the quoted \"per hour\" earnings rates are for completed \"audio hours\" not hours worked. The rule of thumb is that professional transcribers can maintain about a 4:1 ratio of time worked to audio transcribed if the file is clear and of good quality -- so essentially completing 15 minutes for every 60 minutes worked. Amateurs dealing with low-quality audio on crowd-work platforms are not going to hit those marks, so a ratio of 6:1 or  worse is more likely. Earnings of $2-$5/hour are far more likely with online transcription.",

                "text": " GoTranscript is shit. Absolutely not recommended to anyone. These folks usually take even the most crappy quality of audio as long as the client pays for it. They further divide single audio files into multiple parts, which makes it harder for an individual transcriber to know the full context of the audio. Finally, their pay policy is just plain shit. It's highly likely that you will make a mistake somewhere and ultimately 3 files with low rating means that you will be kicked out of the platform for good and won't be paid for the several hours of work you do. Ultimately, I think it is their policy to trick new freelancers into accepting hard jobs and making it easier for their existing pool of editors, while setting up the rules in such a way that they won't need to pay even a penny to most of the freelancers by shoving the blame entirely towards the freelancers. Also, [Rev.com](https://rev.com/) hardly ever takes in new freelancers. I don't know a lot about the others though. Also, be aware of the fact that most of those stated $20-$30 rates are for the audio minutes and not the hours of work you put on it. Usually, a clean 10 minute file with clean conversation will take a transcriber around 40-80 minutes. So expect yourself to put at least 4 to 8 hours for a 1-hour audio file. Transcription is a very competitive sector and the career growth potential is very limited. With AI making transcription getting more effective of late, transcription opportunities will only keep falling in the future.",

However, I think it's important for people to realize what they're getting themselves into.  \n\n\nI worked for Rev, and a lot of the audio was awful. While I had a foot pedal, I found myself rewinding and re-listening to sections of the audio.  \n\n\nBy the time I was done, I'd spent six hours transcribing an hour-long verbatim piece. And I made less than minimum wage to show for my effort.  \n\n\nSo, proceed with caution.  \n\n\nOh, and if you get nothing else, try to invest in a mechanical keyboard, good headphones, and a foot pedal.",

        "title": "How I am making $1,000 a month working online version 2.0: Updated and expanded.",
        "text": "E: You can also check out my post on [using apps to save money and earn cash back](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperSecretSpare/comments/au5am7/saving_money_online_in_2019/)\n\nI posted a very similar post about a week ago, and wanted to repost a lot of the same information for those that did not see it. I also made the post more comprehensive, added a few more revenue streams, and have included updated proof of payment for everything I can. After crunching all of the numbers I can think of, I have made $6,463 since I started doing this in mid-October 2017. \n\nI want to preface this by saying it is not a way to make a full time living for most people. It is a way to make $1,000 a month with substantial time and effort. It is a way to wisely invest your free time to make money while you would otherwise be sitting around. You will not be your own boss, a \"CEO\", or an entrepreneur. If you are looking for that, go peddle essential oils to your friends or something. Take what works for you from this post, and leave the rest.\n\nFor me, the time investment required for these numbers was around 30 hours a week. Feel free to work less or more. 30 hours a week is only a requirement if you want to make over $1,000 a month following this guide.\n\nThe tech required for these numbers: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience. Alternatively, if you do not have any of the above, just go to the public library a few hours a day.\n\nI know that when I was trying to improve my life, working online opened a lot of additional doors for me. I was able to eat when I wanted instead of when I could afford it, but really only did it when I needed the spare cash and didn't feel like donating plasma that day. Since getting married, we have needed extra money for various bills and saving for things we wanted. Because of this, I have been investing more time in all of this over the last 6 or 7 months and the cash flow has been steadily increasing as time goes on. I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner, and have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates. I am now also able to wake up and see that money came in while I slept. It has been rad. \n\nWorking online is something that pretty much anyone can do. If you are already browsing Reddit, you have the tools to make additional income. I am including payment proof as well as direct links to all of the sites, so everyone can see that it is actually possible and get started today (or if you didn't do any of it last time I posted). These are all legit sites and I have not been scammed or jipped by any of them for any amount. None are MLM based and other than basic hardware, none require you to spend money to make money. Feel free to do your own research about their trustworthiness if need be. \n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive guide to everything you can do online to make extra cash, nor is this really that impressive a number to make. I feel like I am actually on the low end of what can be done working online. This does not include some of the more well known sites like swagbucks or earnhoney, as I just do not like them that much. u/gordigor did an [excellent write-up in my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/dx25udg?utm_source=reddit-android) on a more passive way to earn around $50 a month with sites like these. It does not include sites like Rat Race or Appen (I quit Appen and was rejected by Lionbridge). It also does not include tutoring Chinese kids with some of the well known sites, because I absolutely abhor talking to people for the most part (I get uncomfortable explaining myself). This is more a quick overview of how I personally boosted my monthly income by almost $1,000 a month working with ten different websites. While I am in America, many of these sites can be used worldwide. Hopefully someone can find a new revenue stream through this write-up.\n\nThe times I have invested vary greatly, from one or two hours a day to well over 12 hours a day. I average somewhere around $6.25 an hour (admittedly never giving it 100% attention),  but to me that is better than making nothing an hour. While it may seem excessive some days, I actually enjoy making money and I do some of it while I am at my day job, so it has become more of a time filler than actual work. Everyone will have their own experience but these are what have worked the best for me, either in time investment or having a little fun along the way.\n\nI put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).\n\n**[SwagBucks ref](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=50837036)** ($225) Surveys – Majority of countries– This is more of a catch-all for stuff to do when you want to make and save money. You can do surveys, play games, and watch videos to earn points. You can also get cash back from using SB to visit and buy from different stores. You get paid in points which can be used to purchase gift cards or sent directly to PayPal. Each point is the equivalent of $0.01. Usually, SB will have deals where you can get certain gift cards for less. For example, a $20 Amazon gift card for 1800 SB points. The payout can be slow, but if you don’t mind running ads in the background, using a plug-in to save money while you shop, or killing time playing a game, SwagBucks can be a great way to earn $20 a month. [Non-ref]( https://www.swagbucks.com)\n\n**Mturk** ([$2,683](https://imgur.com/a/AhWXpuw)): This is by far the one I spend the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You can get a ton more info from r/mturk. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved. Updated to confirm a few Canadian friends have been accepted. www.mturk.com\n\n**Respondent.io** ([$1,600](https://imgur.com/a/oSpkC5o)): **All of the following links are ref links. Non-ref directly to the site can be found at the bottom**. This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, [like this $120 for people that print at home](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5ade5bf6e42e7f00233d8bf8/seeking-people-who-print-at-home!/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), [this $100 study for men who buy clothing online](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5ade17efe42e7f00233d867e/seeking-men-who-shop-for-clothing-online/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), or [this $150 study for people with spinal muscular atrophy](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5ace5c4b25a322008287f466/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma-patient-journey/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d). There are also a ton of surveys for people based on specific areas of the world, including South America. I only average getting approved for the groups about 8% of the time (I have filled out about 200 screeners and have been selected for 17 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [respondent.io](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11) [non-ref](https://www.respondent.io)\n\n**Usertesting** ([$700](https://imgur.com/a/ab5ptaN)): This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more as you can see on the payment page with the $60 recording, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. www.usertesting.com\n\n**[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/7secondman)** ([$80](https://imgur.com/wobuyuz)): After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, clocks, mugs, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. I have only been at this one for about two and a half months, but see the potential it has. It also takes a good amount of upfront work before you see any dividends. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. www.redbubble.com\n\n**PlaytestCloud** ($150): This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal. No payment proof available as it is not all saved in one place. www.playtestcloud.com\n\n**Secret Shopper App** ($30): This link will take you directly to a sign-up page with my ref code. Feel free to delete it before signing up, if you want. Once registered, you will be taken to the app store where you can download the actual app on your mobile phone. I have not use this app that much, but can verify that they do indeed pay out. Essentially, you go to local stores near you that are identified in the app and take pictures or videos of specific items. I like this one because I have the ability to make a few extra bucks if I am already out and about or shopping at a specific store. The pay for this one averages about $15/hr. [Secret shopper app](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=roberthW77D). [Non-ref](https://app.survey.com)\n\n**Ebay** ([$130](https://imgur.com/a/SVhmvu5)): I have started this very recently. I have started going to Goodwills and other trading stores to pick up wht I think will sell online. There is a whole sub devoted to this. Go over to r/flipping to find out more.\n\n**Usability Hub** ([$10](https://imgur.com/a/U4FhJIQ)): This one lets the user take quick one or two minute surveys on your opinion of an app screen. They pay for this averages to about $.10 a minute, so it is nothing spectacular. Just leave it open in another tab and take a quick survey when you hear a new one come available. This will probably net you about $20 a month, but the time investment is so minimal it tends to be worth it for me. The only problem with this site is that you can't cash out until your balance hits $10. [UsabilityHub](https://www.usabilityhub.com)\n\n**Reddit subs**($400): From test driving cars, to doing homework, to rating businesses, these subs have been a catch all for when I have any extra time to go through them. Honestly, this has probably been the third best pay per hour of work out of everything, after Respondent and Prolific. I just wish there were gigs to find all day. Be careful not to get scammed here. Some people are just... something else. \n\nCheck out r/beermoney, r/workonline, r/slavelabour, and r/jobs4bitcoins. \n\nWell, that is all I have this time. I hope someone can get something from this. Feel free to share any other revenue streams you may have and feel free to ask any questions you may have. I will answer the best I can.",

The thing is, I think it varies from person to person what you'll qualify for. Sometimes I get a lot more. Just a few weeks ago, I got 4 in one night, which was super exciting. Also, most of the tests, for me at least, have been around 20 minutes, but some are only 10 minutes, literally, which is awesome for $10. I think once or twice, I've had a longer one.  I'm sort of a soft spoken person, so it was kind of a challenge for me at first, but you get used to it.",

The Feedbackers is a growing community of people who know how to give constructive feedback. We are currently paying 5-8 dollars per film, depending on the length. The first feedback isn't paid and it allows us to review the feedback, if you know how to write constructive feedback then you are added to our community of verified feedbackers. We are currently recruiting more feedbackers and are looking for English speakers (From anywhere in the world that can accept payment via PayPal) who have a passion for films and know how to express themselves. If you want to join, you can signup at [https://www.thefeedbackers.com](https://www.thefeedbackers.com)If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them here.\n\nEdit: You can check our facebook for reviews from our feedbackers and filmmakers if you want to know if it's legit -  [https://www.facebook.com/thefeedbackers](https://www.facebook.com/thefeedbackers)   \nWe are currently building the community of feedbackers and filmmakers alike, I can't guarantee when you will be receiving films to feedback, so this isn't a full time job, buy something fun to do on the side while earning some money.  \nWe have received an overwhelming response and the amount of people who have joined is incredible.  \nIt might take a while until we get back to everyone with a film to feedback but we are working on it with full force.  \nHave you got a friend who always asks you what you think of his film?

        "text": "(**read:** This guide is more focused on online jobs and general e-finance stuff. If you're looking more for a \"sites to make money on\" guide, I recommend [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/41trkj/shibests_ultimate_guide_to_making_a_living_online/) it still holds up I'd say)\n\nMade a thing like this a few months ago to go into 2019, figured I might do a more updated one now (and hopefully make it more streamlined, the last one was a bit long winded).\n\n**Reddit Subs (all international):**\n\n* /r/forhire\n* /r/hireawriter\n* /r/slavelabour (will likely be garbage rates, but worth monitoring if you really need the money. Some can be a decent $10+ an hour once in a blue moon.)\n* /r/HungryArtists\n* /r/hireaprogrammer (seems to be inactive but worth monitoring)\n\n\n**Remote Job Opportunities:**\n\n\n* Apple At Home Advisor (https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/aha.html)\n* Xerox (https://www.xerox.com/en-us/jobs/work-from-home)\n* Teaching English online (Various, not going to give links because unsure of repute of each company - however Palfish is the name most thrown around here from what I've seen)\n* Amazon (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/virtual-locations)\n* Walgreens (https://jobs.walgreens.com/job/chandler/call-center-specialist-work-at-home/1242/9366069)\n* Walmart (https://careers.walmart.com/corporate/customer-service-and-call-center)\n* UnitedHealth (https://careers.unitedhealthgroup.com/data/jobs/customer-services/813143-bilingual-call-quality-advocate-us-telecommute) - Pretty sure this one requires experience\n* Various other companies hire remote customer service reps in general, a lot do in fact. But you gotta dig through a bit to see who is currently hiring. I recommend using skipthedrive if none of these appeal to you.\n\n**Saving money online:**\n\n* Ebates [Ref](https://www.ebates.com/r/FULLME208?eeid=28187) [Non](https://www.ebates.com) \n\nBasically all you need to know about Ebates is that you get cash back on online (and some in-person) shopping at almost every single online store. You just made an account, go to an online store with their link, and you get usually 1-5% cash back. From what I can tell in my time using it there's absolutely zero drawbacks. Can combine this with a cash back credit card as well if you have one\n\n* Ibotta (Referral code ccikbfi if you want to use)\n\nI recommend the app. Basically an e-coupon service that gives you cash back just by scanning your receipt. Easy to use (a bit difficult to figure out in the beginning but you get the hang of it), decent amount of savings for various products.\n\n* Kiwi.com, StudentUniverse, and Statravel\n\nBest three services I've seen for purchasing flights and general travel arrangements and I've used them myself. SU and Sta are for youth/students and Kiwi can be used by anyone. Flights are typically several hundred dollars cheaper (at least US-Europe) on these sites. Just make sure your baggage allowance is what you need since they tend to have a lot of \"light economy\" flights.\n\n* Honey [Ref](joinhoney.com/ref/aeqsdqz) [Non](joinhoney.com/)\n\nSimilar to Ebates, but I recommend this one for its coupons on certain sites. Automatically applies a bunch of potential coupons for you at checkout. Also offers cash back but that can't be used along ebates' cash back, so see which one offers more cash back when you're shopping online.\n\n* Swagbucks [Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Zamininc) [Non](http://www.swagbucks.com)\n\nIf you're signing up for a service or starting to work for a company similar to lyft/doordash/etc you can get huge bonuses for it. Like for example currently you can get $150 in swagbucks if you start driving for doordash.\n\n**Actual sites to work on that still work as of March 1st 2019:**\n\n* [mTurk](https://www.mturk.com/) \n* [Clickworker](http://clickworker.com/) (note: is pretty dead these days unfortunately, still occasionally good work)\n* [Usertesting](www.usertesting.com) \n* WritersDomain (https://www.writersdomain.net/)\n* [Appen](https://appen.com/)\n* [Lionbridge](https://www.lionbridge.com/)\n* Prolific Academic [Ref](https://www.prolific.ac/p?ref=HECETDIC) [Non](https://www.prolific.ac)\n* [iWriter](https://www.iwriter.com/)\n* [Textbroker](https://www.textbroker.com/)\n* [Constant Content](https://www.constant-content.com/)\n* Contentgather [Ref](https://contentgather.com/r/9790) [Non](https://contentgather.com)\n\n**Other useful sites:**\n\n* skipthedrive (http://www.skipthedrive.com/)\n* Upwork (https://www.upwork.com/)\n* whopayswriters (http://whopayswriters.com/)\n\n\n\n",

They are sort of similar to a Kumon center but more online based and specifically for English learning for Chinese students.\n\nYou don't need a bachelor's degree to apply, but you should get a TEFL or TESOL\n\nYou don't have to have any prior teaching experience, but it's recommended that you do have a little, even if it's just volunteer work or babysitting, something like that where you were in a sort of teaching, leader, or teaching assistant position.\n\nIt was super easy for me to get hired, and I'm a recent high school graduate, only 19 years old, and I moved from the U.S. to Thailand. You can work from anywhere in the world.\n\nI put my referral link here as it is helpful for my position if you do end up joining and getting hired.\n\nBe warned that part of the site is in Chinese and the English translation may or may not be confusing. Just try your best to sign up. It was pretty straightforward in my opinion, but just beware.\n\nhttps://www.likeshuo.com/share/teacher/recommend?refereeId=431C87FE42CA1A7B\n\n\nEDIT: I don't know if other companies do this, but your students often give you tips if you're a good teacher. I get some extra in tips. And I've also received promotions within the first 3 or 4 months of working. There's lots of incentive. \n\nFor example, I got a promotion added to where I can start teaching a class called Demo class, where new students who have never used LikeShuo join the class and I test them to see where their level is and in the end if they sign up for more classes I get an extra payment along with payment of teaching the class.\n\nEDIT 2: People have been commenting and messaging saying the site says you need a bachelor's degree. Let me clarify. NO YOU DO NOT NEED ONE. This is for sure. If it is marked as a must do on the form, then say none(if it's a text box) or if it's a file upload, put your TEFL (if you have one) or a blank picture file.\n \nDuring the interview process they will ask if you have a Bachelor's. Just tell them no. If you are currently working on your bachelor's, tell them you are currently working on it. Either way, it doesn't matter. \n\nEDIT 3: I picked the Junior teacher position. I'm not sure about the others.",

The list of vacancies is available here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NafyaTudHVUWCePMZrROockCXcOp4kNDhDSZRpGAIWE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NafyaTudHVUWCePMZrROockCXcOp4kNDhDSZRpGAIWE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe difference between this list and those that you could see earlier is that vacancies are collected not only from job boards websites but also from companies' sites. According to my calculations, for every vacancy posted on the job board, there are two vacancies that are not posted there. It is difficult to search for companies that post information about open vacancies only on their website, but I consider it important, as it helps good people find their dream job faster.\n\nI made the table editable and I will be glad if you contribute. Add the open position of your company to the table.\n\nGood luck looking for work, I hope my work and the work of other people will benefit!",

        "text": "Yes, that's actually a thing. Turns out there are some websites that pay you to listen to songs and rate them. A couple of websites expect you to  write reviews about the songs and provide feedback.\n\nThey  don't pay too much but if you can manage to work for multiple websites then you can gather a few bucks by the end of the month.\n\nHere are some brief details about these sites:\n\n* **MusicXray.com**:  Seems to be the most reliable and promising of them all. Users are paid  to listen to 30 second audio clips of amateur artists. They pay through Paypal and minimum threshold for the payment is $20.\n* **SliceThePie.com**:  It's a music reviews website that pays users to write reviews about  songs as well as fashion related products. Minimum payout is $10 and  they pay through Paypal.\n* **RadioLoyalty.com**: Pays you to listen to their online radio and listen to the advertisements. You earn points that can be exchanged for Gift cards.\n* **RadioEarn.com**:  Lets you earn passive income by listening to radio online while you're browsing Internet. If you're a website owner, you can integrate it with your website and earn money by allowing your visitors to listen. Pays monthly through Paypal.\n* **Research.fm**:  It is a Music research company that pays you to listen to music and  fill out surveys. You can redeem your earnings with Amazon Gift cards.\n* **HitPredictor.com:** Another music research company that pays users to listen to music and  rate it. You get 3 points (equal to $1) for every song you listen. You  can exchange points for Amazon gift cards and prizes.\n* **Cash4Minutes.com**:  You get paid to listen to the radio and make calls. The average pay  rate is $0.08 per minute. Payments are send through Paypal, Bitcoin and  Litecoin.\n* **Earnably.com**:  You get paid to do different tasks including watching advertisements, taking surveys and listening to radio. Minimum payout is $2. They pay  through Paypal, Bitcoin and Amazon gift cards.\n* **PlaylistPush.com**:  If you use Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music you can monetize your playlists through PlaylistPush. You need to have at least 400 followers  on these channels to qualify for an account. Pay rate of songs depend on  your reputation. They pay users somewhere between $1 to $12 per song  review. They pay through Paypal.\n\nMore details about these websites can be found [HERE](https://www.webemployed.com/make-money-listening-to-music/). Do share your experiences and let us know if you find success with any of them.",

They don't fact check it, don't worry.\n\nStep 2: Apply to Liveops, Sykes, Arise, Concentrix. These are the major work at home vendors. Make sure your resume looks good. Wait for approval \n\nStep 3: They'll probably make you do a speed/spec test, this is the most crucial part. Find someone's good wifi or go to starbucks when no one is there. Make sure you do as many free speed tests as possible before hand to assure you pass. Usually these are one offs if you fail their speed/spec test, you have to do the application process over again.\n\nStep 4: Jump on the right program. All of them have TurboTax which pays $18+ /hr, but that contract only lasts Jan - April. Get you a retail contract like Neiman Marcus or something like Airbnb that's year round. Depending on who your vendor is, you should be able to stack more than one contract. Stay away from trash programs like home depot, Disney resorts, and some others. That's beer money tbh. \n\nIf everything goes smoothly during the work week, you should net $500 - $800 per week, as long as you can keep your ass in a chair. Of course most of these come with startup costs but they ARE NOT scamming you, it's just how these contractor things work.\n\nSource: Am at home working",

        "text": "Hey all! I've been working teaching English GogoKid for and it's been working for me. I had been looking to also work at an extra English teaching company or two, but ended up not needing to after a few months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's the brief rundown of what they require from their teachers, as far as I know:**\n\n\\*Have a bachelor's degree (in ANY major), diploma required.\n\n\\*Must be legally able to work in the USA or Canada. (You can teach from anywhere with decent internet.)\n\n\\*Some kind of experience with children (babysitting, Sunday School, camp work...)\n\n\\*ESL/TESOL teaching English as a second language certificate. You can get these online with a Groupon for $19 right now. (This wasn't a requirement before, but just became a requirement of the Chinese government as of September 30, 2019.)\n\n\\*I don't think GogoKid has any requirements for minimum hours worked (maybe one class a month, I'm not sure exactly).\n\n\\*Reliable high-speed internet connection, your own computer with webcam, headset with boom mic.\n\n\\*At GogoKid, I set my schedule.\n\n\\*GogoKid provides the curriculum, and little prep is required.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What I like:**\n\n\\*Gogokid is newer than most companies, but is financially supported by their parent company TikTok/Bytedance, a huge player in the tech industry in China, so they are solid and definitely not fly-by-night. They started around May 2018, and are going full-steam ahead!\n\n\\*The curriculum is all prepared for you. Of course, the better you know it and the more prepared you are for classes, the better you'll do - minimal prep work is required.\n\n\\*Teachers can set our own schedules. This means you can choose your work hours, and get up to $2K + per month, if you're willing to work overnight shifts. Or, if you're in my position, 10-12.5 hours a week in the morning fits my life exactly!\n\n\\*Classes are 1-on-1. You get to know your regular students, and it doesn't feel \"large classroom\" chaotic.\n\n\\*Each class is only 25 minutes, with a 5-ish minute break between classes. It's enough time to work back-to-back classes and fit in a snack or bathroom break.\n\n\\*Pay is good. Your base rate (based on interviewing, demo class, and experience) starts at $7-$10 per 25 minute class ($14-$20 per hour.) Then, based on number of classes taught, showing up to all classes, and not having technology issues, you bump that hourly rate at two levels to 110% and 125%. ($17.25/hr for $7 base rate up to $25/hr for $10 base rate) Disclaimer... my math or starting rates might be a little off. I think they're right.\n\n\\*They give referral bonuses for recruiting other teachers.\n\n\\*There's a good community of online Facebook groups with many positive people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What can be difficult for people:**\n\n\\*For people without patience, working for a startup can be frustrating as they hammer out the details and procedures. Sometimes there are systems issues, but I've always been fully paid when the technical issues were the fault of the company.\n\n\\*If people don't read directions and announcements, etc., you might find some people complaining about pay timing, pay received, etc. Gogokid has always paid me on time (actually a few days early), correctly, and if there is an error, they correct it. Simple.\n\n\\*Gogokid doesn't assign you students. You have to create your own profile with pictures and a short video as your teacher marketing, and parents choose teachers based on that. You'll typically start with getting a few trial classes, and when you do, rock it, and you'll likely start getting repeat students, then your schedule fills up. Mine took about 3 weeks to fill up with mostly repeat students.\n\n\\*Providing feedback for students. After each class, you're required to write a short feedback for each student within 12 hours of the class time.\n\nIf you're responsible and diligent with your work, and read the instructions, none of these are typically issues for people working for Gogokid.\n\nI'll gladly answer questions. Feel free to direct message me if you have something super specific, to keep the thread clean. ​ If you're considering applying, I'm more than happy to share tips and would be super thankful if you'd use my referral code: UXDZSSSA. Even if you're just considering, you can start the signup process with no deadlines to complete it. Or you can use my referral link: to begin the process here ([https://teacher.gogokid.com/?channelId=344&referralId=UXDZSSSA](https://teacher.gogokid.com/?channelId=344&referralId=UXDZSSSA)). Each person who signs up with the code gives me a referral bonus, so that's another reason to like Gogokid. :-)\n\n([https://teacher.gogokid.com/?channelId=344&referralId=UXDZSSSA](https://teacher.gogokid.com/?channelId=344&referralId=UXDZSSSA)).\n\nThanks in advance!!!!\n\nEDITED: added ESL certificate requirement, required by China government starting September 30, 2018.",

        "text": "Hey r/workonline\n\n\n\nTo preface this, I'm from a country in eastern Europe that no one gives a shit about, so I'm not looking for anything region-specific or that only applies to the US.\n\n\n\nI need a job. One that makes me enough money to live comfortably. I'm 22 and I'm not studying anything because of various reasons, one of them being my lack of finances. I'm looking for something that I can enjoy learning, a skill that I can grow and develop constantly.\n\n\n\nAfter high school, I've tried to learn web development because I thought it was my dream job. A few months later, I realized I was progressing very slowly and the coding was boring me and I could barely keep attention on it. I then switched my focus to graphic design, as I'm a more visual type. I've since learned graphic design to the level of someone who went to school for it. That's the main skill that I'd say I possess. I'm not the absolute best, but I'm also far from the worst. My pricing reflects that as it's very reasonable but not Indian level. I've worked on upwork for a time, but then I stopped for about 2 years because I'm kinda fucked in the head and my interests change all the time. Just as I wanted to get back on the site, Upwork banned my account for no reason, so that's no longer an option. I work with clients from reddit, but the jobs are so few and far between that there's no way I can make a sustainable income from it.\n\n  \n\n\nOther than graphic design, I've taught myself video editing and have tried doing youtube, which went nowhere. I've taught english to Japanese people for miserable pay, which is one of the reasons I've stopped doing it (also anxiety). I've had a Shopify store that I built and designed by myself selling dope edgy t-shirts with original designs, which also went nowhere and in the end I had to shut it down after about a year. Hell, I've even learned the basics of FL studio recently and have managed to create some dope tracks, but I'm not even hoping that that will go anywhere.\n\n \n\nThe pattern that I see is that all of the things that interest me have a very low probability of getting me any money. I desparately need coin though, and the pressure of that lingers in the back of my mind at all times, stopping me from taking on any more projects that take a long time to set up, could potentially provide good results later, but have a high probability of failure (like the t-shirt store). I know that even if I managed to discipline myself to learn something like programming, I'd be miserable doing it for the rest of my life. I beat myself up daily over the fact that it's so, so hard for me to focus on things that I don't care about, and the fact that everything I care about can't make me enough money.\n\n\n\nSo I guess what I'm looking for is others' experiences. I want to hear from people who don't do surveys and clicks for beer money, but do actual full-time jobs online. Maybr I've overlooked a possibility during the years that I've researched online jobs.\n\n\n\nThanks!",

I've done it; I have a pretty high rate of return on that, and on Constant Content.  It always pays better if you can mimic the style of marketing copy.   If you could stand to do that for 3-4 hours a day, you'd make somewhere between $1000/$2000 a month.  \n\n\nA lot of Americans don't like sites like Verblio because they see the rate as too low, but personally I automate things to the point that I can crank out 300 words in 30 minutes.  When I'm actually writing, I'm averaging $21/hour in a region where that counts as a skilled-labor wage.  Having said that I'm only doing it when I don't have other work to do, and I'm just trying to be the secondary, supplemental income for our household.",

        "title": "Impressions after 6 months teaching English online.",
        "text": "I know things about online teaching companies are regularly posted, but I though I'd give my impressions since the ones I have seen on here I feel are often a bit misleading and way too positive. I get it. They want to make as appealing as possible to entice people to use their referral code. I am no different, but I thought I'd try to give a more honest assessment based on my experience after working 6 months online. The TLDR is, yes, you can make up to $24 an hour working from home in your pajamas. But, no, the children are not magical creatures delighted to see a foreigner, the flexibility comes with caveats and the earning potential is dependent on many factors and not guaranteed.\n\nLet's start with the thing most people care about. The pay is really good, especially for what you're doing. Once I started getting fully booked I began to average between 2700-3200 a month. This really can vary greatly because it depends on on how much you get booked and how much you want to work.\nThis took awhile and some work to get to this point. My first month I made about $90 despite being very aggressive and opening as much of my schedule as I could. I have read many in the Facebook groups lament about going months without getting hardly any classes. This job is about marketing yourself as much as it is teaching to be successful. If you can't appeal to the parents as well as please the students you are not going to do well. The key is too attract regular students who book you weekly and recommend you to other parents.\n\n\nThe job is really easy. The lessons are already done and involve hardly any prep other than glancing at them a couple minutes beforehand. Classes are just 25 minutes. But for those 25 minutes you are actively engaged. It can often be stressful to try to get the student through every slide if they are not compliant or struggling to understand. Unlike some jobs like retail where there is a lot of downtime and you can zone out, you are 'on' for those 25 minutes. After about 8 in a row I need a break or my brain feels like mush. Every lesson is recorded and parents will often be right off view  of the camera or will watch the lesson later and are likely to complain if the see low energy, mistakes not being caught and corrected and the lesson finished.  Both of my negative parent reviews came because I dared to yawn in class. (Apparently yawning is a big no-no).The parents often also meddle in the lessons, sometimes trying to do your job and telling the student the wrong thing. One of the worst things is that if the child makes any mistakes is that Chinese parents can sometimes be quite harsh. Seeing a kid smacked or have his ear twisted because he/she can't say something correctly is difficult at times and having a lesson with a parent like this is very tense. The job is really easy, but not without its frustrations.\n\n\nI often read on these that the kids are wonderful and awed to speak with a foreigner. Perhaps the very young ones, but most have had lessons with other teachers and often have had in-person English lessons with teachers. I taught in China for several years as one of these. Chinese students have an unbelievable amount of pressure on them through things like homework and extracurricular activities. There are many wonderful and fun students to teach, but for many, you are just another task on their agenda when they would rather be doing something else. It is often a pain to get students to pay attention when they constantly play with their phones right under the camera and lie when you ask them to put it away. I have had students refuse to follow instructions, swear and make rude comments both in English and Chinese ( I speak fairly decent Chinese from my time living there), and even been flipped off. The strange thing is that the parents will sometimes continue to book you even after you have mentioned this is your class comments and there is nothing you can really do to prevent this. It's a mixed bag, but I will say that I really enjoy most of my regulars and many teachers develop caring relationships, some I have read have even gone as far as traveling to China to visit them.\n\n\nOne of the best things about this job is the flexibility. Work as much or as little as you want. This job offers a great way to add money in your free time, but there are two big things to keep in mind. One is that the schedule for those is the Western Hemisphere is pretty tough. I get up at 3:00 to start classes at 3:30. I sometimes pull all-nighters if I want to earn some extra cash. I am a night owl so this doesn't bother me much, but for people who aren't morning people this can be a difficult adjustment.\n\n\nThe main issue with the flexibility is that in order to get consistent bookings, you often have to open your schedule well in advance, at least a week to two weeks. You can be booked almost any time, but many parents take part in the 'booking frenzy'. This happens every Monday at noon Beijing time when parents are able to book their children's upcoming lessons. Once booked, the policy is quite strict and you need to do that class unless you have a documented reason like a hospital stay. You get 6 cancellations and any more and you are unlikely to have your contract renewed. So if you booked classes in advance and your friend scores some free concert tickets Saturday night, you might have a difficult choice to make.\n\n\n\nThis job has been a real godsend to my life. I don't think it will work for everyone one but some people might really benefit such as:\n\nPeople who live or want to live abroad. I live in South America and was working at an ESL school, making enough to get by, but not much else. Since I started teaching online I have been able to live a very comfortable life, increase my savings and start investing again. This is a job you could do anywhere and if you go to countries with a lower cost of living you can leverage the salary to have a very comfortable life. After South America, I plan to go to Istanbul, Plovdiv, and Bali and others the next few years. There is a whole community of teachers who live this lifestyle and are very helpful and supportive. So if you are stuck in a rut and have dreamed of seeing the world, there are few better ways.\n\n\nThis job also suits people with disabilities or other difficulties. I have a condition that sometimes makes it difficult to leave the house. Being able to work from home has really boosted my quality of life. Instead of waking up, getting dressed and spending 45 minutes with rush hour to make it to work on time, I simply just throw on a shirt and splash some water on my face, have some coffee and sit down to work.\n\n\nIf you have debt and need some extra cash. I was able to get my sister a job at VIPKID and she was lucky enough to get booked quite quickly. She ground out a couple months and was able to pay off her credit cards and is working on an emergency fund now. She is also several months pregnant and plans to take more time off since she can still have a source of income while she takes care of her baby.\n\nThe two companies I work for are VIPKID and GOGOKID. People have different preferences of each, but i prefer and do most of my work with VIPKID. Here are my referral codes if anyone is interested.\nVIPKID    \n[Referral link](https://t.vipkid.com.cn/mkt/landing/personal?referralToken=75a6bd415a9eacecc30698ec1ece997a&refereeId=10576192)    \n[non-referral link](https://www.vipkid.com/)\nGogokid    \n[referral code](https://teacher.gogokid.com/?channelId=344&referralId=EXZHZ7WA)\n[non-referral code](https://teacher.gogokid.com/faq/about)\n\nI hope this can be helpful to some people.

        "text": "**This list (updated frequently) is targeted to beginners and how to make money the quickest in your first few weeks, but it could also be useful to other experienced users. I have cut down on the amount of description for each website in order to make it easier and quicker to read**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHello y'all. I just recently got some more free time on my hands and I decided that I would do something productive with it. I started reading r/WorkOnline and r/beermoney and other websites about 2 weeks ago and it really caught my attention how this could be a realistic supplemental income. This list should be very useful for beginners, as I have just recently started as well and can share my experience with the best paying gigs online.      \n\n&nbsp;\nOne thing that has helped me tremendously in this work online hustle is keeping all my potential sources of income organized in a document so I can remind myself of what I have to do or what I have already done. [This is how mine looks like.](https://gyazo.com/92f97cee27f418e7cb527d279b21be9b)     \n \n&nbsp;\nAnyways. lets just get to the real content. Here is a compiled list of all of the websites where I found success on (screenshot of my earnings on the important ones included):\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Swagbucks](https://swagbucks.com/refer/cajuhbr) [$86] - I really like this one. They have a lot of offers that you can make money very quickly on by spending a buck or two with a trial. This is the best way to make some money quickly as they have a few very good offers ($6 sign up to hulu for $30!), but you will slowly run out of good offers and have to resort to the surveys. [Screenshot](https://gyazo.com/19af4359de76d5dade52cd2e2bf6ec86) - yes I earned $129, but I spent around $43 total on offers.     \n[Referral](https://swagbucks.com/refer/cajuhbr)     \n[Swagbutton referral](https://swagbucks.com/lp-savings-button?cmp=695&cxid=swagbuttonref&rb=54074074&extRefCmp=1&extRb=54074074)    \n[No referral](https://swagbucks.com)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[UserTesting](https://usertesting.com) [$80] - I did have a one week head start for this one (first website I signed up for when first looking), but it is simply an amazing beermoney website. They have amazing rates! They'll pay you at least $10 for a recording of your screen testing a product. They can last up to 20 minutes (I've had 2 tests of only 5 minutes!). [Screenshot](https://gyazo.com/e1e4a12c3281df8500e4c95ae5c3c61b)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Survey.com](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=tiagog83MT) [$75] - It's a phone app. They conduct product audits and merchandising of certain products. For the money I've made so far, I had to go to gas stations and take pictures of the current stock of JUUL products and answer a few questions on the app. $5 per gas station. [Screenshot](https://gyazo.com/66696d428fa523e362d7ee41cc75e803)          \n[Referral](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=tiagog83MT)         \n[No referral](https://app.survey.com/register)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**NEW addition to the list. Just got a $75 survey with them so it puts it pretty high in my list**        \n[Respondent.io](https://https://app.respondent.io/r/tiagogrimaldirossi-41a9a00ab2ba)[$75] - Survey website that conducts on-site and online interviews. Most of their offers pay well over $30/hr but it's really hard to get qualified for the surveys.\n[Referral](https://https://app.respondent.io/r/tiagogrimaldirossi-41a9a00ab2ba)\n[No referral](https://app.respondent.io)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com/get/cajuhbr?f=give) [$28 - got a job with $90 payout at end of month] - Freelance website where you can sell any kind of job for as much as an employer is willing to work. It has a lot of competition with people from foreign countries in the easier tasks, so I recommend taking jobs where the employer is looking to hire someone from the US., [like this](https://gyazo.com/777cd8b57984ccbc460b03075817ebd0). **Watch for scammers.**      \n[Referral](https://freelancer.com/get/cajuhbr?f=give) - not sure how it works but they claim that you get $20 for using the referral     \n[No referral](https://freelancer.com)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[PlaytestCloud](https://app.playtestcloud.com/signup) [$11] - Mobile game testing. They send out no more than 5 games per month and you test the games for around 30-45 minutes and get paid. As simple as that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Drop](https://earnwithdrop.com/) [$5] - They pay you $5 if you use a referral code at first (mine is k6vrr). The app gives you % cashback on 5 stores that you can choose. **You can't change that later, choose carefully**     \n**People are having issue with the free $5. You have to LINK your card and CONFIRM your email. It seems like most havent confirmed the email and earned the free $5.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Mobile Performance Meter](https://embeepay.com/mpm/bin/invite/5129606230/887b) [$2] - They pay you $.15 a day just to keep the app in the background of your phone when it has battery. You gain $1.50 as a new user.      \n[Referral](https://embeepay.com/mpm/bin/invite/5129606230/887b)      \n[No referral](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embeepay.mpm) - not sure if they have it for iOS. Apple users just type \"Mobile Performance Meter\" on Apple Store and find out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n/r/gifcardexchange [$7]: This is not really working online, but I only found out about it as soon as I started researching online money making websites. Basically, you can exchange gift cards for 70-90% of the value. Very useful for me as I buy a lot from Amazon.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nList of websites that I am yet to hear back about my application:        \n\n- Cambly        \n- Appen       \n- Lionbridge       \n- 3PlayMedia       \n- Babbletype      \n- iSoftStone     \n- GoTranscript                 \n&nbsp;\n\nList of websites that I just haven't had luck with yet:            \n- Clickworker              \n- Userinterviews             \n- MTurk (got approved just recently)               \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nHope I could help. If you need some more info on these websites, most of them have their own subreddit that will be more than enough to answer further questions! (but you can also ask me :D)\n",

Go on Linkedin, go to the company page, search for the recruiter or HR person in the job title of the employees\n2. Use [hunter.io](https://hunter.io) to get their email address format (50 free per month) and then send them an email with the resume you submitted. Sample email templates can be found here:  [https://www.thebalancecareers.com/resume-follow-up-email-example-2062544](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/resume-follow-up-email-example-2062544)\n\n**Subject Line:** Programmer Position - Jane Doe Application\n\nDear Mr./Ms. Last Name, \\[if you have a name, otherwise omit this line, try to get a name though\\]\n\nI hope you are well.

I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis increased my call back at least 35% and it takes about 5 minutes of extra work.

Today I am going to share a list of 7 websites where you can find and apply for **remote creative writing jobs**.\n\nWhen it comes payment rates and other payment details, I wasn't able to find info for all of the websites. But these companies are legit and they do have a solid reputation.\n\nHere's the list of websites:\n\n1. **Pw.org** **(Poets & Writers)**: You can apply for writing, editing and publishing roles. New positions are regularly posted on their website. Payment rates vary from client to client.\n2. **BunnyInc.com**: Writing Bunny hires talented creative writers and editors to work for them online. You can apply as a creative writer, translator or a Voice actor on this platform. Payment methods are **Paypal**, **Payoneer** and **Wire Transfer**.\n3. **WeLocalize.com**: They hire freelance Ad copywriters and translators in multiple languages including German, Dutch, Japanese, Turkish and Vietnamese. They pay the writers every week.\n4. **SportsNetworker.com**: If you're into sports then you can apply for this website as a \"Feature Columnist\". They don't pay upfront for your writing, however. You will earn commissions on every sale generated from your content.\n5. **Contentor.com**: You can apply as a writer or translator. You will have to go through a strict evaluation process to become a part of their team. They haven't shared any payment details on their website.\n6. **RelayPub.com**: They have three roles that you can apply for, namely, writers, editors and designers. They will give you an idea or a topic and you'll have to write a story / book revolving around that idea. Payment rates for each word range from **$0.03** to **$0.06**.\n7. **InboxDone.com**: They pay you to manage email accounts of their clients. You will be responsible for crafting replies, communicating with customers, business partners on email, collaborating with potential clients. You will have to undergo a 30 days training period. You'll be paid for that period of course.\n\nI hope you like these websites and land a creative writing job on at least one of them. More details about these websites and their links can be found in this list of [Creative writing websites](https://www.webemployed.com/make-money-as-creative-writer/).\n\nDo share your feedback and experiences.",

        "text": "After many months of my husband and I trying to do odd jobs to keep our family afloat, getting extremely behind on bills and being so stressed out we basically worked, fed the kids and went to bed, I am finally starting my new job working from home today! I am so excited. This subreddit kept me from giving up on looking. It also helped me find small things to keep me somewhat going on the side. Thank you all for all of the support you provide to people like me who need to work from home. Today I start with Amazon customer service and I couldn't be more excited. I will have a steady paycheck and I can help my husband get our family out of this hole and start moving forward. If anyone has any questions please feel free to reach out to me and I will do my best to answer them. Happy Monday everyone!!!\n\nUpdate of first day:   Wasn't too bad! The first 3 hours or so was dedicated to setting up equipment and introducing ourselves. There was a little hiccup for some of us who were sent faulty equipment so we had to call IT. Was on hold for about 2 hours. And the remainder of the day was dedicated to online training modules. This is about how any other work from home job I have goes the first day. I enjoyed it. My TM (Team Manager) is very nice. My team seems awesome. I am aware that Amazon may not be the greatest place to work in some people's opinions. But what I want to stress is that my family and I were about to be homeless. I was in the process of losing everything. I am completely open to criticism, I am not under the impression that everything will be butterflies and rainbows, nor did I ever claim that. BUT...sometimes you don't get to be picky when it comes to work. I have done MUCH worse for far less money. The schedule may end up sucking, the whole thing may end up being miserable. But like I said before, it's a job. And God knows I needed it. At least at the end of the day I get to hang up my headset and spend time with my family. I know a lot of people who work jobs they absolutely hate. But that's why it's called a JOB and not a hobby. If you have a job you love, you are a very lucky person! Thank you all for your support on my first day!!!! Here's to day 2! 😄",

        "text": "If anyone is looking for a great go to online job to help with the bills I recommend teaching at QKids. I have tried several online teaching platforms and I have found Qkids to be the easiest to apply to and get working. They do not require an  TESOL/TEFL/etc, but do require an associates degree. They give you all of the materials needed to teach the class, so going over lessons only takes a few minutes at a time. The only downside is that they pay you once a month on the 15th, which can be hard to get used to compared to most jobs that are bi-weekly or weekly. They also give you group classes so there is less pressure to be a great teacher to a single student as you have a different group of kids each lesson.\n\nIf you wish to apply using my referral you can use this link here  [http://teacher.qkids.net/ref?code=MATPNV](http://teacher.qkids.net/ref?code=MATPNV)\n\nIf not you may apply at  [https://teacher.qkids.net/](https://teacher.qkids.net/) .\n\nThis has been a great job for me as I am currently working on my masters and do not have a lot of time to work and go to school, but with the pay rate of 16/hr with bonuses I average $800 a month working only 10 hours. There is a potential to work up to 19 hours a week with even more bonuses, but i have not done that and can not speak for how that bonus system works. If you have any questions feel free to post below and i will do my best to answer them!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I forgot to include that this for US or Canada Based only, for a teaching platform available anywhere check out  [https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing](https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing) . This company however does require a bachelors degree.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks to new information from u/teachersharon qkids now \"automatically do a criminal background check and a education verification check, on all newly hired teachers. Even if they pass the interview, all new applicants must also pass the background and education verification check, before they'll offer them a contract\". So if you do not have a bachelors or a tesol cert you will be not eligible for this position, so be sure to have one or the other when applying, if i manage to find an tutoring resource that does not require either I will update this post.\n\nEDIT 3: I apologize for the misinformation, but they are now requiring you to have at least an  associate's degree,as pointed out /u/ThegoddessInari, so make sure that you have that when you apply.",

        "text": "Just got this notice in my email from Rev: [https://imgur.com/a/OMEWvKK](https://imgur.com/a/OMEWvKK)\n\nI never received under a 3 for either metric on a job. I calculated my performance average and it was 4.5/4.5. I only had to surrender two jobs after the Unclaim deadline, one because I fell ill and couldn't complete. I never received a penalty notice for either job dropped.\n\nImagine my surprise when this termination notice came into my inbox. The fact that the 'target metric' for accuracy was 4.5 and I was terminated for a 4.4 is kind of hilarious. Considering that Rev chooses audio that is unpolished, unedited to assist transcribers (i.e., ear splitting background noises that don't affect the audio's meaning aren't edited out, RIP headphone users!), and UNBELIEVABLY bad audio quality on most jobs,  I could not care less that my account was terminated.\n\nThe reason I'm sharing this is because it's a total waste of time to work for Rev if you want side cash. I made only a total of 9-10 USD per hour, no where near enough for the aggravation. Often, it took forever to flick through all the terrible audio and find a suitable job. I had to replay clips over and over to make sense of them. I had my ears ache on several occasions when I wore headphones (see above).\n\nThe best way to describe working for Rev? Try to write what two people with masks over their face are saying, but listen to them through a door, and throw a static filter over it for an added challenge.\n\nAs much as this company annoyed me, this notice felt like a slap in the face when overall I offered good work. Maybe there are better transcription jobs online out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit: Based on recent comments, I'd like to add that I'm also disillusioned by my Rev experience because of the disparity between the test audio and audio you transcribe once hired. Personally, I found the test audio doable; it wasn't 'easy' but I only had to replay it a few times. Looking back, I would never have signed on if the test had reflected the real challenge of their terrible audio.  \n\nDishonesty from the get go isn't a good look for any company, so if you're on the fence about avoiding, I hope this sways you not to sign on.",

It's a free Chrome plugin that has been a huge help to me as a transcriptionist. You can fiddle with the different levels, but I find just boosting the volume makes a tremendous difference. When combined with noise cancelling headphones, it makes a lot of the audio more doable. There's no saving something that's absolute garbage though.",

I’ve been making about a hundred dollars a week but I was able to make even more in the past couple months putting in some extra work, a little over 200 dollars for a week’s worth of transcribing is the most I’ve made at once. The longer projects tend to pay off better in my experience. Once your score drops it is hard to bring it back up though. Definitely not the side job for everyone.",

                "text": "There are many legitimate work at home opportunities out there, they typically are not really stable, at least until you have a lot of experience. Even things like teaching ESL online takes a while to break into and get consistent recurring students. The jobs also usually pay based on a deliverable vs hourly pay. This means that the same job might make you $20/hour and sometimes $3/hour depending on how many hours it took you to complete it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want stability, my recommendation is to try several different ones at once to see which ones you enjoy doing and also get traction with a few. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've broken down the most common online opportunities that could correlate to a decent hourly income based on the type of work and left out ones that are more hit or miss (like affiliate marketing or blogging), are passive income (like selling stock photography) or are quick money but pay little (like online surveys). For each one I describe how it works and the most common site for each. If you want to know more or see more related sites, check out the link to my blog. Hope this helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Graphic Design Opportunities:**\n\n\\- [Selling Custom Graphic Designs on Design Marketplaces](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/08/making-money-from-selling-graphics/) *(decent hourly income)*\\-  Sites  like 99Designs are design marketplaces where designers upload    their  portfolio and clients come with small projects they need done.   Then either clients pick a designer they want to work with, a designer    bids  on a project or a design contest is setup where multiple   designers   submit designs and the winner gets paid.\n\n\\- [Selling Custom Graphic Designs on Freelance Sites](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/06/making-money-gigs/) *(decent hourly income)*  \\- With  sites like Fiverr or UpWork, you can sell your services much    like  design marketplaces. In fact design marketplaces are simply more     specialized freelance sites. The one big difference is the type of  work  available on generalized freelance sites.\n\n**Translations Opportunities:**\n\n\\- [Translator](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/24/making-money-as-an-online-translator/) *(decent hourly income)*   \\- These are specialized freelance sites like Guru or Globtra. You choose what languages you are proficient in translating between, do some    tests and then can choose projects translating from one language to another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Teaching Opportunities:**\n\n\\- [Online ESL Teacher](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/04/16/teach-english-online/) *(decent hourly income)*  \\- With sites like GoGoKid or Landi, you can teach kids in China English  and make pretty good money while you are at it. You either need a  degree or be in the process of getting a degree, but what the degree is  doesn't matter. You can pick and choose the hours you work and if the  parents like your style then you can get regular students.\n\n\\- [Teaching](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/04/making-money-through-online-coaching/) *(decent hourly income)*\\-  If you were good in school you can teach/tutor kids in grades  anywhere  from G1 to college through sites like Chegg or Tutor.com.  Sometimes it  is one on one and sometimes it is a class. While some sites  require a  bachelor degree in education, not all do. The money is pretty  good and  it is all work from home.\n\n \n\n**General Online Work:**\n\n\\- [Social media/forum moderator](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/20/making-money-moderator/) *(decent hourly income)*  \\-  Flexible work through ModSquad where you can work online as a social  media/forum moderator, often for larger clients (such as NFL).  It is  something different and is quite flexible\n\n\\- [Data Entry freelancer](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/06/making-money-gigs/) *(decent hourly income)*\\-  Through sites like UpWork or Fiverr you can get short term projects doing work like data entry. It can take be tricky to get work initially   as competition is fierce and you are just starting off, but the work is  flexible and pay can be really good.\n\n\\- [Research assistant](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/18/making-money-online-by-researching-questions/) *(decent hourly income)-*   I look at this as an online business detective. This is where companies need detailed research into complex business questions, such  as \"what is the market potential for solar panels in Arizona\". They work  through a company called Wonder. You then research different sites   to    come up with your own analysis and summarize it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Writing Opportunities:**\n\n\\- [Writing product reviews](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/04/02/making-money-online-by-writing-product-reviews/) *(decent hourly income)*  \\- Write product reviews for pretty much any different product you can    think of on ReviewStream. You are paid for well written, opinion pieces  and the pay is pretty good.  Your review may be rejected as it isn't  unique  enough  and the site is extremely confusing, but you can make  $10+/hour  on it  if you post well written and unique articles.\n\n\\- [Content writer on a content mill site](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/04/05/making-money-online-freelance-content-writer/) *(decent hourly income)*  \\-  Content mills are writer-focused specialized freelance sites such   as  ConstantContent or WriterAccess. They are a good entry level way to  build your portfolio even though it may be hard to make a lot of money  off the start.\n\n\\- [Freelance professional writer](https://studentonlinehustle.com/2019/03/06/making-money-gigs/) *(decent hourly income)*  \\- This uses the same UpWork and Fiverr sites, except instead of just  doing writing you can also provide other services as well, such as  graphic design, marketing, web development, etc.",

I personally have been working online since the winter of 2012. I started off doing phone work and quickly learned it wasn't my strong suit. I quickly searched for alternatives and began transcribing with a couple of the crowdsourcing sites. I began with Appenscribe about this time as well, which at the time paid out the best and also offered other types of projects that I could qualify for later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince transcription takes a bit of time to gain experience and training, I found other steady work to supplement my income in the form of search engine evaluation, which is basically manually scoring search results to compare against actual search results in order to better train the search engine. This allowed for a steady part-time wage working a few hours a day as a safety net as I continued pursuing my ultimate goal of having my own contract transcribing service. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I mention my story is to highlight the endless possibilities. Not to take away from traditional online employment positions, I personally just like working without constraints. I did work for TeleNetwork, and outside of all the anxiety, it was a pleasant experience otherwise and would certainly recommend them for anyone comfortable on the phones.

Since it's treated me well and they brought back inviting other people I thought I should share the love again (helps me out anyway) and tell y'all about the app. \n\nNiceTalk is a basic app where you [sign up here](http://tutor.nicetalk.com/) and chat with those learning English in China. The set up was quick and easy for me back then and should take only two days to have you up and running as they have to authenticate your application. You'll tell them a bit about yourself and make a quick video so dress up slightly nicer and you'll be set. \n\nI personally liked it as I was able to help myself become less of an introvert by just speaking to people. The people you might meet could literally be five years old to sixty. Their experience could be bare bones, super thick accent to sounding like a native speaker. \n\nMy referral code is TI65DQ18 for those that could help me out and use it would be nice.

        "text": "I've been working from home for a few years. I love almost every aspect of it. However, it seems like all the people in my life think \"work from home\" means \"unemployed,\" so I'm always the person they go to when they need a favor. For the first few months, I happily did some favors for people. I babysat my nieces, I dropped things at the post office, etc, etc, etc. Then I realized nobody even appreciated my efforts and I wasn't getting enough work done, so I stopped.\n\nNow, years later, people still ask me to do things and try to guilt me into it. Sometimes I try to explain calmly that I don't have the time. Other times I just say no and leave it at that. It never works. And it's not like I never say yes. If I have the time to do something, I will. But, like literally every other working adult in the world, I don't have the time during my working hours.\n\nIt's affecting my relationships with people. I've built a resentment toward the people I'm closest to. Also, I've developed the reputation as the person who says no when people ask for help. My brother-in-law has even derided me for \"making excuses.\" I seriously don't get it. It's also taking a toll on my mental health. I've always been the generous and kindhearted one in my family and group of friends, so this new reputation is really getting to me.\n\nI'm starting to find other self employed friends and distancing myself from the old ones. At this point, it's easy to let them go, but I can't do that with family. So, how do you guys get people to understand that just because you're home, doesn't mean you have free time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses so far. I've already done most of the suggestions and it hasn't worked with my family. Again, my friends are not an issue. If they never learn to respect my time, I'm fine leaving them. But family is different.\n\nI had an idea though, so if you're in the same boat, you might try it. I'm going to start writing down all the times they ask for a favor or ask me to leave work for anything. Then I'm going to show it to them on a weekly or monthly basis so they can actually see how little work I would be doing if I did everything they asked. I think a big part of the problem is that they just don't realize how much and how often they're requesting things.\n\nIt's really nice to see I'm not the only one that has had this issue!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: A lot of people are telling me to put up boundaries. Have you guys read my full post? I don't agree to do things I don't want to do anymore. I have boundaries. The problem is that the people in my life try to make me feel guilty because I HAVE boundaries, not because I don't.",

Basically that something had changed and I didn’t have the in between time that I used to. \n\nThen just kept repeating it every time they asked and did not give into anybody. They eventually stopped asking. I got the the point of asking one person that was relentless about asking if I could bring my kids into her work for two hours on Tuesday and Thursday so I could go for meetings at my work. She responded that she can’t have them there because she’s working and I said exactly why I can’t help.  \nThe best thing I’ve found is to keep consistent with everybody.  If everybody hears the same thing, it will eventually hold. And it’s easier that way.",

Tired of seeing people post about just VIPkid or the other main ones around here without trying to elevate what they are about and why you should apply?\n\nMe too. Does this sound like a spammy beginning? eh...maybe? I don't know anymore. But really, I've worked for or currently work with all of these companies. Real feedback and honest critiques incoming.\n\nI've been teaching offline and online for years. I do it off and on and I make a livable wage out of it. At least enough for a very comfortable life traveling the world, not London or anything.\n\nI've done other jobs for various companies as well. Whether it is curriculum development or blog writing, there are aspects to it that are more than teaching. \n\nLet's get started-\n\nALL COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR HOURS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. ALL COMPANIES NOW REQUIRE A DEGREE UNDER A NEW CHINESE LAW. NON NATIVES, I WILL MAKE ANOTHER POST FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE. \nCOMPANIES PAY BY PAYAL OR BANKS. LIKESHUO REQUIRES A SWIFT CODE.\n\nThe companies are ordered as: (and you can jump to the one that interests you)\n\n**Dada**- Best for getting the job done and not worrying about much else. 16-19/H\n**ALO7**- Best for the community, management, and possible upward mobility. $15-$17ish/hour\n**Likeshuo**- The rare whale of teaching to adults in non-morning hours. Best coupled with another for max income potential. $14-$16ish/45 minutes\n**GogoKid**- Strong contender for the best overall. Best Pay- $16-$24/hour.\n\nMAIN TEACHING TIMES= 6-9PM BEIJING TIME. EQUIVALENT TO 5-8 AM currently for EST USA. West coasters better be ready for late nights or early mornings.\n\n**DADA (Formerly DADA ABC)**\nBest for inexperienced or new people who are ok with no feedback or guidance. Think of Dada as the best \"Trial by Fire.\"\n\nTL,DR DADA- Dada is for people with thick skin or just trying to dip their toes into it. The new management has gone off the rails when it comes to a lot of things, but more importantly, they don't actively engage the teachers. The facebook group is a dumpster fire on most days, but you can get some help there.\nRealistically 18-ish an hour. \nSign on Bonus- Maybe? A small amount for props or such.\n\nClasses and bookings.- Classes are 1 to 1 for 30 minutes. You start off with trial classes, which can be 14 minutes or 30 minutes, depending.  You get a normal student and they book per week. I teach some once a week, others multiple times a week. It will take you a couple weeks to start to have a steady schedule.  Set schedule of days. Pays %50 when not booked during scheduled times.\n\nPlatform- The platform is clean and modern. Really, there aren't really any negative points. It is, for the most part, stable and happy. They just added a few AR borders, so it is staying updated. \n\nStudents- Students range anywhere from what they can convince the parents is early enough to 14 years old. You will mostly fall within the 6 to 11 age group, however. Dada appears to put a lot of money and time into the student side and keep them happy, so this is good.\n\nCurriculum/materials- Dada has some decent material to teach. Some still have questionable phrasing but the characters are there and the grammar is usually strong. Where they shine is the partnerships with Scholastic and National Geographic. Teaching stories from your childhood and real science is fantastic. \n\nThe Bad- Dada is pure chaos and mismanagement. Some of the decisions they make are confusing, or at least how they choose to implement things with no explanation. If you can't do well in a dysfunctional family, maybe it is best to avoid. Also, they mean 30 minutes. Not 25 like the other companies. There is next to no time in between classes. \nIncentives...who needs incentives? Those were forgotten long ago.\nThey change contracts when it suits them.\n\nThe Good- This is a great place to start to even find out if you enjoy the work. A lot of people have had no issues and have been there for years. Your mileage will vary. The pay is decent, but please remember they pay in  RMB, so fluctuations and trade wars may bring sadness. You will get trials. You will get bookings. It works. \n\nPay- The pay range is in the air. Realistically they will pay from $16-$19 an hour depending on how you do in training. But remember, you teach a full 30 minutes per session and have student reviews to do for each class each day. Those take time and generally longer than you think.  %50 standby time. Full compensation for No shows.\n\nApply- [nonRef](https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing) and [REF LINK](https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing?referrer=w0v4H5H9H105)\n\n**ALO7-** \nBest for a true team environment and all around inclusiveness. The teacher count is a lower number than most others which helps foster good will and a super supportive network. \n\nTL,DR ALO7: ALO7 is for people seeking a sense of belonging and family. With a wealth of support, materials, and a management team ALWAYS ready to listen to new ideas and allow for growth; ALO7 is a great part-time gig that can turn into more. But, if you are just teaching, don't expect to quit your day job. Consistent scheduling important.\nSign on Bonus=$50\n\nClasses and bookings- Classes are small groups, either 1 to 3 or 1 to 6 (majority are 1 to 3) You are booked by partner schools for a set of lessons lasting 10-40 weeks long. The students will have learned the materials in an off-line class and in the online class, you are helping reinforce their learning.  Classes are either 25 or 50 minutes long depending on the course you are assigned.\n\nPlatform - Currently they use a meeting platform called Zoom in which you share your screen with students and have the ability to draw on it. Alo7 is working on their own platform but at the moment it is still in the development stage. \n\nStudents - Ages range from 3 to 14 years old. There are only a few classes at the moment with very young learners. The majority will fall in the 6 to 11-year-old range. Here is where group classes can be nice because if one isn't responsive, you don't have to spend 20 minutes staring at each other or cajoling them into speaking. You can still engage with the other students and hope that the quiet one will catch on \n\nCurriculum/materials- Their flagship course is well thought out and inspired. The character are the most memorable of all the companies, as well. There are some odd courses but each is tailored with a different school in mind. What sets ALO7 apart, is they started as a curriculum developer for schools before they went into the online market.\n\nThe Bad - The pay is the lowest among Chinese online companies (see below). Their new platform is frustrating because it isn't bug-free but they are still trying to implement it with live classes.  Depending on when you are hired, you may have to wait a while to get assigned classes and a stable schedule is a must. This is not a company where you can take off classes willy-nilly without penalties because partner schools may see you as unreliable and be less likely to book you. \n\nThe Good - The company is transparent and you are well informed of changes and expectations. It is usually easy to get answers from them, either through Tutor Support or from their Facebook group. They are compassionate like if you have a class or tech issue, they do not immediately write it off as your fault. You always have a chance to tell your side of the story. The biggest benefit is \"upward mobility\" or at least contracted side projects such as proofreading curriculum, interviewing team, voice acting and others. \n\nPay - All tutors get a base rate of $15/hour regardless of experience. They have two types of bonuses, one for stability (no last-minute cancellations) and quality (measured by an Alo7 team, not based on student feedback).  No stand by pay, sadly. Full compensation for no shows.\n\nApply- NonRef and [REF LINK](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftutor.alo7.com%2FALO7_recruitment%3Finvitor%3D545%26fbclid%3DIwAR2oHujcice4Oq6hx65433cd5AFVhO7mp1CuCPbpl6SJNRdZi9xoQZUavR0&h=AT2_2JtXEYKM7c0Ce4aagNhPQTZHzcIzrPTyjcjdKaz9V2IzLXgNiSmt2OH9px4HaFD40bj6Kwp2OynQF45yYGvAtmvu3NxPJo0NbQQTGlrl-Y_oT5H-BFBlDQBMOzM0bFyKqA)\n\n**Likeshuo**\nBest for people who prefer teaching adults. Possible to teach children as well. Longer classes hours at all times are possible. Really, a different beast when comparing it to the others. \n\n\nTL,DR- Likeshuo is perfect for completely flexible schedules. Good pay for the time per class and all around interesting lessons...even if some are a miss.  Bookings are a wave of randomness, as is the teacher assistant you will get for your point of contact. Learn to ride the wave.\n\n\nClasses and Bookings- These come in two types. Tutorial classes and Private classes. You will teach 1-4 people, but they will not have their video on. Only you, at the podium, are able to be seen. the classes are 45 minutes in length regardless. Students book you directly and classes fill up here and there. Bookings can be great or minimal depending on countless circumstances. \n\nPlatform- I love the platform. It takes time to get use to not seeing the others you are instructing, but it becomes natural over time. You can insert your own material to supplement and you can share your screen as well. It works quite nicely. The platform is capable of allowing all participants to use video, but most do not want to. Understandably.\n\nStudents- I have no experience with the child aged students. Otherwise, adult students are just as you could guess, all ages and locations. Chinese, but also people who are living abroad or going to University abroad. This is where the schedule can be more open than the others on top of adults sleeping later. They are all more motivated because they are paying for their lessons, it is great. Some will have medium level English while others are approaching fluency, it all depends.\n\nCurriculum/materials- While some courses can be not so great, overall, you never know what you are going to be teaching and it can be a great time. For others, if you are not well versed in topics like Hat etiquette to Obama's speech style, it can take time to prep for the lesson. For others who are great at knowing a little about a lot, it is a dream come true. \n\nThe Bad- bookings can be hit or miss. One week is booked for everything you open, the other week is empty. But this can happen with many companies. Also, some people have had problems with not being the \"type\"  they want for teachers. You can infer what I mean by this. The pay isn't great, but considering it is only 45 minutes, it is actually competitive and great.\nAlso, cancellations and missing a class on the teachers' part can be costly in fines.\n\nThe Good- Setting your own schedule. Literally, open and close any time you want. No set schedule needed. I've been booked an hour before when I just opened it up.  Teaching adults isn't as exhausting, either. Just a lot of great things I can say.\n\nPay- Depending on your trial class, pay can range from $14-$17 per 45 minutes. The main incentives come in the form of student tips, and can add up to be a decent amount over the course of a month. You can also get an attendance bonus if you manage to teach upwards of 70 or 80 classes in a month.\nFull compensation for no-shows.\n\nApply- [Nonref](https://www.likeshuo.com/recruit/teacher) and [REF LINK](https://www.likeshuo.com/share/teacher/recommend?refereeId=B20BFDDC7ED8339E)\n\n**Gogokid**\nBest at paying and incentivizing like a champion. Best for interactive and modern courseware. Best for people wanting more freedom to your schedule as it isn't set. You make it when you want it.\n\nTL,DR- Gogokid is a new upstart in the game. But with the financial backing of tech giants in China, it isn't a fly by night company. It is here to stay and they are doing a fantastic job. Great pay, great platform, and great flexibility are just some of the reasons GGK ranks highly for me. The random incentives are also a huge plus.\nSign on Bonus $UNsure now EDIT\n\nClasses and Bookings- Classes are 1 to 1 and chosen by the parent.  You will start with trial classes until your points go up and start getting CORE classes.  The classes are 25 minutes and full of interactive curriculum with a large range. Kids from 2 to 14 years of age with the curriculum to accommodate. It took me 3 weeks to be 90% filled with CORE classes. \n\nStudents- Students are happy and engaging. Same as the other children based platforms. \n\nThe Good- Huge incentives and bonuses. Great courseware that is more interactive. Obviously the pay, and if I'm honest, the referral bonuses as well. But also a great community on Facebook and filled with teachers who are happy to be there with very few complaints.  Also, you can change your schedule almost any time you want to, truly different from other companies in this regard. Maybe not great for some. \n\nThe Bad- Being a new company, they still have some platform and tech issues here and there. The system might have issues or the classes may not load properly. This is fairly infrequent and they do a great job of compensating you properly when they do.  Growing pains happen.\n\nPay- Pay is great. you with be paid a base rate of $7-$10 per 25-minute class depending on your interview and trial class. With incentives, which are easily achievable for anyone you add two tiers; 10% and 25%. Bonuses like Christmas bonus come often and are quite high, up to $150 for the month. And the sign on bonus is up to $EDIT Unsure.\n\nApply- [NonRef](https://teacher.gogokid.com) and [REF LINK](https://teacher.gogokid.com/?channelId=344&referralId=R3HRXTYA)\n\n\nThanks for reading. There will be some FAQs that happen and I'm glad to answer them. If anyone wants super specific details on anything, please PM so I don't bore the others.\nI've left a lot of information out but I hope this helps someone.",

I'm in Brazil right now, and working 1-4 hours a day 6 days/week has been almost enough to sustain me for now, but I'm about to head to Europe and know my expenses will be much higher. I like the sound of Likeshuo for the broader range ages and available hours, and Gogokid sounds like another good possibility, though I'm not sure how I would balance that with VIPKID since the peak hours are the same. I plan on looking into both of them and seeing what would work. If you have any advice or further info about either, I'm all ears. Thanks again for writing this post!",

They also seemed, again on paper, to be a more above-board and transparent company. I made about $250, and it was true that the work was somewhat more interesting. I'm not a legal expert by any stretch, but I'd much rather transcribe a deposition for a legal case than another fucking WWE episode, and unlike CrowdSurf, Rev actually allows you to pick which jobs you would take and organize them by subject.\n\nI was with them for all of two weeks, ending about 90 minutes ago.\n\nThe problem is that unlike CrowdSurf, Rev doesn't break audio up into small and manageable batches.  You get the entire audio file, whether it be five minutes long or two hours long. Regardless of the length of the job, you have one hour to return the job after accepting it or you are *severely* penalized. By that I mean that if your ratio of tasks unclaimed after one hour to tasks completed exceeds 1 in 8 then you are terminated immediately. No warning, no probation period, not even so much as them contacting you to ask if there might have been a mitigating circumstance. You're just *gone*.\n\nI was not told that this was the policy. I was well aware that you have to keep your ratio below 1 in 8 but I thought, silly me, that the policy would be implemented in some kind of rational manner or that there would at least be an appeals process.\n\nThis presents a problem because there are situations in which the guidelines specify that a project *must* be unclaimed.  In this case, it was because the audio was of such poor quality that the task was unworkable.  After about an hour of fiddling with playback and audio filter settings on my end it became clear that the reason for this was that the requester had sped up the audio by 25% in order to shave a few dollars off of Rev's price, which is something that's easy to spot if you know what you're looking for, especially if it's done poorly as it had been in this case. Per the guidelines, I unclaimed the project and reported it.\n\nFive minutes later I get an email saying that my account has been closed effective immediately because my \"commitment ratio\" fell to below Rev's standards and that the decision is final. I emailed support to explain that I was just following instructions, and got back a rude email telling me that they have no appeal policy, that it was my own fault, and pretty much telling me to get lost.\n\nIt astonishes me that it's legal for a company to treat their workers this way.  I don't care if we're just \"independent contractors\", that shouldn't be an excuse to violate labor laws.\n\nSome other issues:\n\n\\-The forums are like a cult. You are not allowed to criticize any aspect of Rev, the UI, the payment policy, the behavior of some requesters, guidelines, any of it, or people will leap down your throat telling you how grateful you should be to Rev for everything they do. I looked into the CEO of this operation and he is a full-tilt [narcissist](https://mixpanel.com/blog/2017/12/05/rev-ceo-jason-chicola-ai-intelligent-humans/). It boggles the mind that this guy apparently made it through MIT.\n\n\\-Rev has no payment processor. They don't even use a professional service like Work Market. All of it goes through Paypal, which I find to be completely unprofessional, especially in 2019. But Jason Chicola seems like the sort of person who would have tried to get away with paying the workers in Dogecoin so maybe it could have been worse.\n\n\\-The guidelines are changed regularly and without warning or explanation, often in completely capricious ways. The most recent change was yesterday when apparently the rules were changed so that transcribing \"gonna\" as \"gonna\" instead of \"going to\" went from being standard practice to being a major style error.\n\n\\-Unlike CrowdSurf, Rev does not break up audio files into smaller and more manageable pieces. You get the whole audio file.  This isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Sometimes having access to the whole audio file means that you have context that you wouldn't if you were doing it in 30-second pieces. But it does mean that deadlines become relevant, and Rev's deadlines are not reasonable. 30 hours to transcribe a two hour file might seem like a lot, but if that two hour file turns out to be, say, an astrophysics or med school lecture, then you have to research everything on your own because you will be penalized for not knowing the proper terminology. Every city, institution, historical name, or obscure bit of jargon must be researched and transcribed or you risk getting a nasty penalty on your grade. Expecting this much to be done in the allotted time is nuts.\n\n\\-Just in general, if CrowdSurf is being held up as an example of a company that's better than yours, it's a sign that you're doing a lot of things very wrong.\n\nSo yeah, stay far away from Rev.",

        "title": "Happy Holidays! My super in-depth write-up to working online.",
        "text": "Hey everyone. This is an all-inclusive write-up compiling all of my past posts on how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through pretty simple online work. I figured with the holidays coming up, we could all use the extra cash. I am posting again because this is a full-blown compilation of everything, and I am sure there are some people that haven't seen it. Plus, I am including updated numbers from my last post, and a link to the guide I put together with even more stuff (like passive earning, saving money with apps, teaching Chinese kids English, and a lot more).\n___\nAs stated, I put all of this info into an e-book, plus a TON of other stuff that was either written by me, or compiled from others (with their permission). I am attaching a paid and free link. If you're interested in paying for it (much appreciated if you do!), it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126) for under $1. Free version is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YiBY-6mYr1tEFa7hbZFdRkQtE2Gu4DHK/view?usp=sharing).\n___\nBecause this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income, I won't pretend you can survive with only this. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. \n\nAs I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will include time requirements to make this money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. \n\nI personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix. This works better for my temperament and preferences. \n\nTech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. \n\nThese are combined numbers over the last year.  Anyway, on to the revenue streams. There are some refs, clearly labeled, as well as non-ref links: \n___\n**[Respondent.io ref](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)** ([$4,300](https://imgur.com/a/oSpkC5o)): Studies - Most countries - This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. I only average getting approved for the groups about 10% of the time (I have filled out about 400 screeners and have been selected for 40 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [Non-ref](https://app.respondent.io)\n\n----\n[SwagBucks ref](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=50837036) ($225) Surveys – Majority of countries– This is more of a catch-all for stuff to do when you want to make and save money. You can do surveys, play games, and watch videos to earn points. You can also get cash back from using SB to visit and buy from different stores. You get paid in points which can be used to purchase gift cards or sent directly to PayPal. Each point is the equivalent of $0.01. Usually, SB will have deals where you can get certain gift cards for less. For example, a $20 Amazon gift card for 1800 SB points. The payout can be slow, but if you don’t mind running ads in the background, using a plug-in to save money while you shop, or killing time playing a game, SwagBucks can be a great way to earn $20 a month. [Non-ref]( https://www.swagbucks.com)\n___\n**[Mturk](https://www.mturk.com)** ([$3,142](https://imgur.com/a/AhWXpuw)): Small tasks and surveys - US mainly. Confirmed also in Canada, Europe, & Aus. - This is by far the one I spent the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved.\n___\n**[Secret shopper app ref](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=roberthW77D)** ([$485](https://imgur.com/HfQ7PZw)): In-person store evaluation - US only - This link will take you directly to a sign-up page with my ref code. Feel free to delete it before signing up, if you want. You will be taken to the app store where you can download the actual app on your phone. Essentially, you go to stores near you that are identified in the app and take pictures or videos of specific items. I like this one because I have the ability to make a few extra bucks if I am already out shopping. The pay for this one averages about $15/hr. [Non-ref](https://app.survey.com)\n___\n**[Usertesting](https://www.usertesting.com)** ([$800](https://imgur.com/a/ab5ptaN)): Website evaluation - US & maybe select others - This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. \n___\n**[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com)** ([$305](https://imgur.com/a/bI5TNO4)): T-shirt creation - Worldwide - After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. [25% off ref code for first order over $40](https://www.talkable.com/x/VznBIO). You save $10 or more, and I get a $10 credit if you use this code.\n___\n**[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com)** ([$190](https://imgur.com/a/SVhmvu5)): Selling goods - Worldwide - Not much explanation needed here. You buy stuff in-person low, and sell online high. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/eBay-Beginner-money-knowledge-inventory-ebook/dp/B07HT4Y9J6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540416148&sr=8-1&keywords=ebay+no+money) is a $1 beginner's guide dedicated to flipping (also mine).\n___\n**[PlaytestCloud](https://www.playtestcloud.com/signup)** ($190): Video game testing - Many countries - This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen and voice. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal.\n___\n**[UsabilityHub](https://www.usabilityhub.com)** ([$15](https://imgur.com/a/U4FhJIQ)): App testing - Many countries - This one lets the user take quick one or two minute surveys on your opinion of an app screen. They pay for this averages to about $.10 a minute, so it is nothing spectacular. Just leave it open in another tab and take a quick survey when you hear a new one come available. \n___\n**[UserInterviews](https://www.userinterviews.com)** ($50): Studies - US & maybe select others - Similar to Respondent, but with less approval when filling out the demographics for each study.\n___\n**Reddit subs**($2,300): It is super simple to use Reddit as more than a social media tool or news website. Knowing the right subs to subscribe to, and what to look for, can help you make a few extra hundred bucks  a month. There are a ton that you can find small or medium jobs on, but I am only going to outline the top four that have worked for me.\n___\n/r/slavelabour: This sub is normally dedicated to doing cheap jobs for people, at cheap rates. I have both had things done for me here, as well as completed a lot of tasks. It may seem daunting at first, with people offering $2 to write an essay (seriously though.. no homework here), but there are gems to be found. Two of my best jobs have been creating meal plans for $60, and [finding the name of a book for $80](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/92k4n0/task_find_one_of_my_favourite_books_80/?ref=share&ref_source=link).\n___\n/r/WorkOnline: A gold mine of information on different websites to check out, gift card survey opportunities, and other generally helpful tips. I have never made money directly from there, but have gotten tools that have helped make at least a thousand over the last year.\n___\n/r/signupsforpay: Since slave labour does not allow paying people to sign up for websites, this is where to go to make a few bucks with signups. From connecting your gas and electric information, to signing up with Acorns, I have probably made a grand total of $100 here. Nothing overly special, but $100 is $100.  \n___\n/r/giftcardexchange: This is one of my favorites, because you can buy and sell all of those gift cards you have/want. Have a $20 gift card from a family member that you will never use? Sell it here for 80-90%. Want to buy Amazon gift cards for less than face value? Get 'em here. I do a lot of buying on Amazon, so this sub has easily saved me hundreds over the course of using it. Caution: Trade carefully. \n___\n\nI know this is a lot of info and a bunch of it is repetitive from my last post, but I wanted to provide as much info as possible for the compiled post. Well, I hope it helps!\n___\nAlso, if you are in a position to give or participate in the 10th annual Reddit Secret Santa Exchange, sign up [here](http://www.redditgifts.com/?inv=E7c3)! Maybe one of you will get my gift this year. Even if we aren't a match, you can help make someone else's day brighter :)\n- ",

        "title": "How to succeed at Rev",
        "text": "1. Recognize that you will not make minimum wage from day 1. This is not like a brick-and-mortar job where you show up and get paid per hour right from the start, even when you’re learning how to wear your uniform and how to log into the computer system.\n2. Recognize that their ads that say you “can” earn “up to” $1500 a month are truthful, but you might be misreading them. “Can” does not equal “will” and “up to” means anything from $0 up to that amount, and every dollar amount in between. It is not a guarantee that you will EVER earn that much in a month.\n3. READ THE FORUMS. Seriously. Even if you don’t want to participate, because forums “aren’t my thing”, you still need to READ them. Every day. Read questions that have nothing to do with the file you’re currently on. Read Lend an Ear posts and see if you can hear things the same way as other folks.\n4. Look for Rookie Welcome information. Even if you never ask another question on the forums, ask for Rookie information. I know there’s a Rookie Welcome packet on the captioning side; I’m not sure if there is a current one on the transcription side or not. These are invaluable tools put together by other agents, not by Rev itself, and this information will save your bacon many times over.\n5. TAKE SHORT FILES. This is a bit harder to do on the transcription side than it is on the captioning side, but it’s still possible. As a Rookie, you get 45-100 minutes on the transcription side, and 60-150 minutes on the captioning side, to get all your metrics lined up. The more individual jobs you do, the smaller the impact a single grade will have on your overall metric. (And if you can’t do basic math to figure out the metrics system, you’re in trouble.)\n6. READ EVERYTHING on the site. This means not only the Style Guide, but also every Help Center article that is pertinent to the side of Rev you’re working on.\n7. Use “Explore My Editor” and “Explore My Dash” to practice doing a file that won’t be graded or turned in. Use it to practice concepts and to add text expanders.\n8. USE TEXT EXPANDERS. But don’t try to put in 100 of them on day one and try to use them all. Add in only 1-2 per day, or even every couple of days, and make a conscious effort to remember them and use them until they become second nature. If you have to, backspace over the full word and put in the text expander instead when you catch yourself using a word that you have an expander for.\n9. Recognize that you will be SLOW AS MOLASSES to begin with. You’re not only learning a brand-new interface, you are learning the Style Guide, and learning a new skill. (Yes, even if you’ve ever done this job elsewhere, it’s still a new skill.) But there will come a day when all the buttons are familiar to you, the Style Guide is familiar to you, and it will go much more smoothly and quickly. You won’t be stopping every 30 seconds to look up something.\n10. LEARN YOUR STRENGTHS. Are you horrible with non-American accents?  Only bad at Australian accents? Then don’t do files with them! You are not required to do any job that’s available, even if those are the only jobs available. You don’t get bonus points for taking on a difficult job. This also applies to files with a lot of cross-talk, with the wind blowing loudly, a job that was recorded in a diner at lunch rush, etc. Let somebody else tackle it. Yes, even if that’s the only job available.\n11. DON’T DEPEND ON THIS AS YOUR SOLE INCOME. Every freelancer should have multiple eggs in their basket. Never depend on any of them for all of your work.\n12. UNDERSTAND HOW GRADING WORKS. As a Rookie, every file you do will be graded before it’s sent to the customer. The graders do not grade the entire file, they only do clips of each file. Therefore, it is possible that you might do something in several files that is incorrect and it just isn’t caught because it’s not in the grading clips. So please don’t get mad and pitch a hissy fit when it eventually does get caught. Also, graders are NOT out to get you, nor are they trying to keep you from graduating, nor are they trying to prevent you from getting to Plus status once you’re a full Revver. Grading is TOTALLY BLIND, and the grader knows nothing about your current status or metrics.\n13. UNDERSTAND YOUR METRICS. They are explained on the metrics page, and in a link within the Style Guide, but not well. You can learn more about how each individual metric works on the forums.\n14. Use an audio enhancer and SOME kind of earbuds/headphones. Chrome has 3 free enhancers that I've seen recommended: Ears, Audio Channel, and Volume Booster. For Mac, I've seen Boom 3D recommended. And if you can afford it (maybe after a few paychecks) you might want to consider buying FxSound if you're on a PC. (It's 20% off this weekend!) As for basic listening, DO NOT use your computer speakers. You need the sound going directly into your ears. It doesn't have to be expensive earbuds or headphones, but some type is needed. You absolutely WILL make accuracy mistakes if you use your computer speakers. Later, you might consider some slightly better ones, but they never have to be super fancy ones.\n\nYes, it would be nice to be paid more at Rev. But if you learn how to play the game and work the system, you can make decent money there. Definitely more than American minimum wage. You have to be willing to put in the time and effort to learn the job, though.",

        "text": "5 YEAR UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!:\n\nHey all, I haven't been on reddit in some time but I remembered posting this and wanted to give an update. After this post, I left my then husband and started cleaning houses. Thats where I met my current husband! We have been together for four years and he has adopted my children. He came into their lives when they were 1.5 and 7 months old and has never left. Hes a wonderful father to them, brags about them any chance he gets, and is honestly a better parent than me most days. I started and graduated college and got a degree in computer science and I am typing this from my cozy living room while waiting to go pick my girls up from school then to meet my husband for some frozen yogurt. Life got better. Thank all of you who were here for me during this horrible time of my life. It is so appreciated and a lot of you need to know that you probably helped change my life that day just by being kind. Thank you <3\n\n\nPlease don't roast me, I'm having a hard enough time. \nSo my husband is a drug addict and has been for some time, we have two beautiful baby girls together and he filled my head with the \"you'll never work baby, you'll stay home and take care of the kids and I'll provide everything we need\" bullshit. So I never went to college, don't have an extensive resume, etc. Well his drug habit has taken over his life, has him spending $3000 a month and basically making me beg my mom for help with bills. \nI had a job offer, went to take it, and he blew up on me saying our girls needed me. They do need me. They've been through SO much the last year and a half. I have decided I'm strong enough to finally leave him but I need financial security. The cost of living where we live is relatively low so I just need something stable enough to make about $500 a month. I know of Mturk but also know it's dead now. \nWhat kind of certificates (or something like that) could I get to start working from home? Obviously if nothing works I will try to just go to a physical job. But my babies need me right now and to be completely honest, I need them and can't imagine sending them off for 10 hours a day. Again, please be kind to me. My heart is so broken.",

                "text": "I am so sorry for what you're dealing with. I commend you for being ready to take the next step and do what's best for you and your girls. I've got a number of suggestions, and again I apologize for the lengthy comment but hopefully this info may help.\n\nDo you have a car? I lurk a lot of side gig/other relative subs like r/beermoney and r/frugal and r/povertyfinance. I think r/sidehustle may provide ideas as well. Anyway I've read about many people who have been able to make some decent money just being a delivery driver on weekends (pizza/chinese restaurants, UberEats, DoorDash, PostMates, etc). If you don't have a vehicle there are also a ton of apps out there, besides the survey ones, that really do work depending on location. They offer various \"gigs\" for specific amounts of money that pay out to your PayPal. I've specifically found success with \"GigWalk\", \"EasyShift\", \"Survey Merchandiser\", and \"Field Agent.\" Even if you don't have a car, if you have the transportation to get to these gigs, they're easy 15-30 minute shifts that pay so long as you do the gigs right. I also use \"Eureka\" which is technically a survey app, but the surveys are literally 3-4 questions and you get an automatic 15 cents per survey. If your survey is selected as the \"best responses\" then you can get a bigger payout, but regardless the 15 cents is guaranteed and will add up over time. From doing these app gigs I've made $70 (collectively) in the last week and a half.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I know you may see this a lot but you really can make some decent money: dog walking and dog/pet sitting. I made $200 cat sitting for a friend last week and that was just stopping by 2-3 times a day (though some people don't mind/encourage overnight stays). I use Rover. com or Wag. com for pricing references. Boarding/sitting at your own house may even be a good gig for you if you aren't allergic and it's feasible for you to have pets in your home with you and your girls. That way you don't have to leave your house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look around job sites, there are some jobs for customer service work that are done online. You just need a phone and computer to take calls/chats. So that's also a possible option. Just make sure you do research and the company offering the job is legit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, now is a good time to go through your things and find whatever you have that you don't want or use, and try to sell it, rather than toss things. eBay, Facebook marketplace, even apps like Wish and similar selling apps are all options for selling items of all varieties. You'd be surprised what things of value you may have stored or hidden away. Make sure you know your market so you don't under or oversell on items, and include potential shipping costs so you still make a profit. AND/OR hold a garage/rummage sale.\n\nThis suggestion partially coincides with having a car, of course, but if you use cash back apps for any purchases you make - groceries, gas, etc - you will get, well, cash back! I use the GetUpSide app and it tells you which gas stations offer you cash back per gallon and how much. Even if you don't have a car, there are cash back apps that will give you cash back on purchases at specific stores. There's a ton in the app store, both for iPhone and Android! Just an idea to use for purchases you'd be making anyway, might as well check and see if you'll get cash back out of them!\n\nTry to make a budget for yourself and follow it (income vs bills and necessities, money left should go to savings, etc). It will absolutely help you through all of this. There's r/ynab sub for some help, but they mostly use an app. If you have any specific budget/help questions I'm happy to assist, as I have been planning my semi-monthly budgets for a couple years now and it's really helped me stretch dollars out and save money when I absolutely need it.\n\nMost importantly, take care of yourself through all of this. When help is offered, please accept it. If you have a support system, please use them, that's what loved ones are there for. It's going to be a tough time, but remember that you are doing the best thing for you and your children. I'm sorry for the novel and I know this went a little off track of just online work. I've been in a similar position financially, and just want to help however I can. Wishing you all the best, mama. You're strong, you've got this!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Side note - while much of Reddit strongly discourages go fundme accounts and such, there's a subreddit called random acts of pizza if you ever find yourself really struggling and just needing some dinner. Be sure to look up any local food banks in your area, they often actually end up with too much food and depending what it is, may have to toss it. So please don't feel embarrassed or shy about going to one! Obviously these are some last-resort options but it's good to know in case you want to save your limited grocery money and use it on a bill instead. I'll edit this later if I find other similar subs) EDIT: check out r/assistance !",

A stable environment like that would be beneficial for you and the girls.\n\nIf you can't get a Walmart type job, or want to supplement one, some decent online options include Appen, Lionbridge or iSoftStone. Some of the positions require a post secondary education, but others don't. There's also online customer service (chat, phone). Companies are training people up for the holiday season, so now is a good time to start searching for contract positions like that.\n\nI sincerely hope everything works out for you and your family. <3",

That makes sense, I know that Tulsa has been making a push to be more attractive for tech companies. I actually live 2 hours from Tulsa, so I'm sort of considering it.\n\nI hope that this is a push for more cities to offer programs like this.",

        "text": "Hi guys. I heard about Transcribe Me on here and was excited. So I tried it. And I wanted to give people who have never done it my first impressions so they know what to expect. And maybe receive some feedback from others who have done it longer than me. So I have done TM now for a month. I pretty much have nothing, but complaints. So be prepared for my venting. But I guess I am not the only one.  I just wanted to add my experience. Here is what I have seen so far:\n\n\\- I make on average about $4 USD a week. Ha ha. Yep. There it is.\n\n\\- You have to be up early in the morning to get any work. So no sleeping-in. What kind of work-at-home job is this?\n\n\\- I am registered for \"North American English\". But I have yet to receive any work in this dialect. It is mostly Indians, Arabs, and Mexicans. And I cannot understand 5% of what they say. If that.\n\n\\- If you can't understand what they say, you will not get paid for your time. QA will reject it.\n\n\\- The audio quality of the files sounds like someone is sending you a distress call from 1831 through a rip in space-time bounced off the Moon and ripped through a black hole. If you can't hear them, you don't get paid for your time.\n\n\\- You can't get your money unless you have at least $20 USD in your account. So after sitting here for a month, 12 hours a day, I STILL can't get paid!\n\n\\- QA will mark wrong, on average, 3 words per 2 minute audio file, as spelled wrong. Yet they spell it the exact same way in the correction!\n\n\\- QA wants the entire 2-4 minute text block to be one sentence. No periods. Is that rule even in the Style Guide?\n\n\\- Ah yes, they Style Guide. A 39 page book of rules on how they want the text formatted. You thought this was just typing? Oh no. It's like learning an entirely new language. A new way to communicate in English. Kind of like the people in the audio files.\n\n\\- I am a native English speaker, from Canada, with an MA in English, and teach English professionally(Don't judge by my internet language, please.) And for me, my score after a month is 63%. Ha ha.\n\n\\- You have to do research on every audio file. If the speaker is talking about companies in India, for example, you have to research ALL those company names, spell them correctly, and format the names exactly. \"KriShnA Spiritoowell HeelinGz\" has to be spelled out this way exactly, if that is how the company spells and formats it. Just researching the company names, personal names, technobabble, if you can hear it, place names, and so on, will take at least 1 hour, for a 2 minute audio file!\n\n\\- Yammer. You are REQUIRED to to do a \"Water Cooler\" chat with other Transcribe Me employees on the website Yammer. This involves learning about Indian and Mexican holidays, talking about people's cats, how gay they are, and anything else you can imagine. And, YOU DO NOT GET PAID FOR IT!!!\n\n\\- So far, every audio file I have had has been the same arrogant college kid, basically interviewing foreigners over the phone. The same guy who owns the company. While you hear someone in the background already transcribing. What's the point?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I had more to mention. But you get the idea. Does this ever get better? Thanks for reading!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- I forgot to mention. One of the plugins they tell you to use, \"Grammerly\", corrects your spelling and grammar for you. AND IT'S ALWAYS WRONG! So you basically lose money for using the plugin they tell you to use! Ha ha. Thanks guys for the support. Cheers!",

I'm part of the customer support team for a start-up .\n\nMy daily tasks are live chat, email support and demos. The live chat is for technical and billing support for our users. We are a SaaS company, and many of these companies use HUMAN live chat - some do use bots but we are seeing a huge shift in actual human live chat - users prefer it and it is a high sell value to potential paying users to be able to speak live with someone.\n\nI do not work remotely but many do. Our remote team members (who do the overnight shift) were hired off of Upwork. You can find many live chat roles and email support roles at AngelList (this is where I wad hired off of), weworkremotely.com, remote.co and the nodesk website.\n\nTo get one of these jobs you should have strong multi-tasking ability, around 60 WPM typing speed, some knowledge of support software such as Zendesk/Intercome/Help Scout (if you don't watch demos or youtube videos about it and you can at least say you are familiar with it). There are also the companies that provide outsourced user support  - Concentrix being one. Other than those website try searching \"remote customer support\".\n\nYou will be expected to hop on a user call every once in a while depending on your role. When you apply for a job make sure you know the software or have a good enough idea on how it works so the company know you have potential to be a 'product expert'.",

        "text": "So, just after completing a month on TranscribeMe, and barely making enough to cashout, $19.21, I was fired. Fired? How is that even possible? I am working for roughly 50 cents an hour, with an MA from the USA.\n\nWell it all stems from Yammer. What is Yammer? It is a place where TM transcriptionists can discuss their cats, what pills work for the voices, and visas to America. And, you don't get paid for it.\n\nWell someone posted a work related question that I thought I would be nice enough to answer. \"Guys, when transcribing, is it OK, O.K., or okay?\" Well I know from teaching English, that the correct form is \"OK\". However, on TranscribeMe, it is \"okay\". I know this, as I have lost money for spelling it as \"OK\". Lot's of times. Hours wasted. So I explained, for TranscribeMe, it is \"okay\".\n\nImmediately 20 people commented to the effect of \"Why are you so hostile to us!? Don't do this to us! STOP SHOUTING AT ME!!! You are WRONG!!!! I've worked here for 20 years! And you ALWAYS spell it \"OK\"!!! That is what us intelligent people call the RULES!!! You don't like it? Then STOP working here! I am a TR! You got that? I am a TR!!! You are OBVIOUSLY reading the WRONG SG, buddy! I'm watching you. Do you know that? I'm watching you!!!!\"\n\n\"SG\" is short for \"Style Guide\". It is a stupid rule book on how THEY want you to type. Totally contrary to English grammar. Not only are the 4,000 rules stupid and annoying, but the QA's never follow them! Now, I actually just checked the SG, and there is not rule for OK/O.K./okay. There IS an example sentence of a feedback word spelled \"okay\". So where did the \"rule\" of \"OK\" come from then? Who knows.\n\nBut after being verbally assaulted by everyone, for helping, I posted \"Ha ha! Wow. You are a bunch of nutters, arn't you?\"\n\nI wanted to say more. Yet, I was immediately banned and received an e-mail to the following: \"You are hereby fired from TranscribeMe. We can not have our employees threatening the lives of others. We are considering police action against you. Do not contact anyone from TM again. You are now banned from ever working with TranscribeMe\".\n\nWow guys. There you go. First time in my life I have been fired. And somehow \"okay\" is the worst death threat ever. Or was it \"nutters\"? Who knows?\n\n**The good news? Since I was \"fired\", from an independent contrator's job, they said they are finally going to send me my $19.21! So if you work for TM, and they owe you money, but you can't get it, because it is less than 20 bucks, but you gave up on the company years ago, just go onto Yammer and say something bad about cats or fat people. You are sure to get your money quick! Ha ha.** \n\nThanks for reading guys!",

They currently facilitate teaching Chinese speaking children English but the expansion in hiring is in preparation for an expansion in student language groups.\n\nAnyway.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\nBachlors Degree or higher\n\nOne year of teaching/tutoring experience\n\nQualified to work in the USA or Canada \n\nDecent Internet connection\n\ncomputer (clearly)\n\nWebcam\n\nA Lamp (this will be important)\n\nWired headset (wires are *very* important to them)\n\nSelf control when shopping (Just because you CAN use it as a teaching aid does not mean you should buy it, no matter how cute it is)\n\n**Pros:**\n\nChose your own hours.\n\n$18-$24 per hr pay depending on class type\n\nVery little over head. (you will need a lamp and some props in addition to your computer and webcam)\n\nWork from home.\n\nThey are #VERYRESPECTABLE\n\nDirect Deposit Pay.\n\nThey offer free training and certification\n\nDaylight Savings Time is actually a time of great rejoicing for those in the Pacific Standard Time zone.\n\nThey are great about providing tax documents.\n\nThe Children are wonderful. They are eager and delighted to be talking to a REAL PERSON FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY! The parents are usually cool.\n\nThat moment when the child really GETS IT.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nIt IS contract work. So everything that goes along with that.\n\nNo hours guaranteed.\n\nThere is a \"paying your dues\" phase where you will need to take whatever students you can get to build a reputation. You need good reviews to get students...but you can't get students till you get reviews.\n\nDepending on your timezone the best booking hours range from inconvenient to unholy. (Looking at YOU PST!)\n\nYou have to do your own taxes.\n\n**Minimum Payouts: Payment Options: ect.** As this is a #RespectableCompany they have actual paychecks (direct deposit) but there are various options for when that can be found here [https://www.vipkidteachers.com/tp/support-center/faq/51/37](https://www.vipkidteachers.com/tp/support-center/faq/51/37) .\n\nExtra Notes: I once got a look at the parents' side of the website. It talked a lot about (google translate so take it for what it's worth) \"Pure North American Accents\"\n\nThey actually prefer you DON'T speak Chinese.\n\nYour energy level is a big factor. No energy level is 'bad' but different levels are preferred by different aged students. Serious for older students, and rabbit on caffeine for younger students.\n\nYou will start using TPR in public on fellow adults. Accept and embrace this.\n\nThere are a ton of demo videos on YouTube. Just go to YouTube and search for VIPKID. It will be informative.\n\nTechnically you could make money by referrals. I personally have yet to do so but it is at best 10% of a months pay.\n\nReferral Link [https://www.vipkidteachers.com/mkt/landing/personal?referralToken=42cb6e625b97522eb8cb236053ab5384&refereeId=9621255](https://www.vipkidteachers.com/mkt/landing/personal?referralToken=42cb6e625b97522eb8cb236053ab5384&refereeId=9621255)\n\nNon-Referral Link [https://www.vipkidteachers.com/](https://www.vipkidteachers.com/)\n\nThere, I have done my duty to my employers and brought honor to my family. Enjoy this rabbit hole.\n\nP.S. It is the year of the pig. /-oo-\\\\\n\n   Kh5ihjNuLN2",

        "text": "About three months ago I spent hours on end trying to perfect the knowledge that Appen asks from you to do their stupidly hard entrance exams. For these exams you get a \"guidelines\" file of over 200 pages.\n\nI passed the exams on my first try (with luck), but according to some people I've heard speaking about the same exams, it is failed a lot of the time and sometimes it takes them weeks/months to even respond with your exam results.\n\nWhen you finally start the actual work, you find out how stupidly misleading their \"17$/hour\" promise is. You're expected to keep track of how many tasks you finish and you'll find out their 20(!!) task per hour minimum is unrealistic as fuck, and not only that; you are expected to work a number of \"\"\"hours\"\"\" minimum per week.\n\nFirst of all, you don't even get that many tasks on a normal day. They literally just stop coming. Second of all, if you decide to sacrifice a bit of quality to get more tasks done to actually get some actual money out of your slave labour, your account immediately gets deactivated for \"review\". This review consists (at least in my case) of your account getting no tasks for WEEKS. Then suddenly out of the blue without any warning, you get tasks again.\n\n\"Whatever.\", I thought, I'll just keep working so that I get paid at least... WELL. At the first of the next month, I submitted an invoice for around 9 hours. I worked a WHOLE lot more hours than that, but I filled it in using the dumb minimums they force on you, thinking I might get faster in the future.\n\nThese fuckers in their so called \"Support Team\" sent me my invoice back with a note: \"Maximum time allowed is 2.85 hours.\"\n\n\nNot sure what Appen is thinking, but I hope the lot that organizes the \"Shasta Maps Evaluation\" dies in a car fire. Hope nobody else gets scammed by these scumbags.",

A couple years ago I had Lyme and then due to the medication ( I think) I had a stroke. You think you're a low energy person and then you get slammed by some disease and some people claiming to be doctors take all your money -- mm mm then see how your energy is. \n\nI know how to create websites, I do data, I can write and I can learn anything, but really no matter what I did I just  couldn't see given the way people rip you off for that kind of stuff that it would sustain me, mostly emotionally. I believe fully that these things do afford people an income, I just could never make it work. \n\nHowever, this year I loaded all my extra books on AMZ, explored becoming an AMZ seller and also opened an account on Ebay. I sold books most of the year plus the odd discount merchandise item every once in a while there, but after a while I realized I was only making about two dollars per item which is...I mean I could probably dumpster dive  for more than  two dollars a day. \n\nHowever I also started working an Ebay account and sold basically stuff around the house. Then I started going to goodwill to get more stuff. It has taken me months and months and months to figure out how to make my inventory  sell into a profit, and my best month is now a month where I profited 250 dollars.  I am probably pretty typical. It takes time and thought and work to get even that much out of it. However - it is doable. It is also rewarding to know that \\*you can always make money\\* if you need to once you figure it out. And now, every month, my profit just keeps going up.  Instead of getting scared because I'm disabled and aging, I got to work and now know this will probably work until something else comes along if anything ever does. \n\nThat in itself is worth all the effort, because once you know that you become sort of...unimpressed by anything that doesn't matter much.  I also wouldn't pay much attention to people who say you can't do it, because they literally and truly ( with respect) don't know what they're talking about.  I have personally met people who are making \\*crazy\\* money doing exactly what I'm doing.  There are other online \"jobs\" and then there is at-home customer support -- you can also do transcription but if you do those things the unappealing thing about them is you give up the best thing about not having a job, which is \\*all\\* of your time is your own and if you want to sleep for four days, you totally can.  I think you just have to think  differently than most of America,  and get to work on yourself instead of worrying about how to be appealing to...everyone else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're gonna be ok. And so am I :) Best.",

There are other online customer service (call center, basically) type jobs that people work full time (with benefits). Tutoring English (check out /r/OnlineESLTeaching) is also an option if you have a degree (I think people usually get about $20/hr doing that).\n\nIt depends on where you live and your cost of living too. When it was still allowed I was getting about $1200 a month from Appen and an additional $300-500 with Raterlabs a month. That was enough for me to be considered FT and to get by where I'm at. Since Appen bought Raterlabs we can no longer do that, but there are combinations of working for other companies (Lionbridge or iSoftstone) that can get you to full time hours. \n\nThe staple companies are Appen, Raterlabs, Lionbridge and iSoftstone and most people will agree, however, that you shouldn't 100% rely on those jobs as your only income. They all have a varying degree of risk (you can have your hours cut without notice or be dropped from a project). I've been working as a rater for over 3 1/2 years (others as long as 10 years) and have been mostly secure with it. But there are definitely stressors that would be added if I was relying on this as the only way to support myself. It can be done but it's always in the back of your mind that you might not have the job the next month.",

        "text": "[Crosspost from r/povertyfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8c9in2/last_week_i_posted_a_guide_on_making_1000mo/?ref=share&ref_source=link)\n\nI put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).\n\nOriginal post:\n\n>I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/) a few days ago detailing how I am making roughly $1,000 with six different websites and how most people can start taking advantage of them. I was flooded with messages asking why I posted it and questions about some of the sites I use. To answer the first question, I wrote the last post (and this one) because I enjoy seeing people better themselves. I grew up in poverty, dug myself out as best I could to this point, and want to see other people do it as well. Everyone deserved to be happy. \n\n>I wanted to take a little bit of time today to write up a new post adding in three more revenue streams, as well as talk more about one I received quite a bit of feedback on. \n\n>[Respondent.io](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11). [Non-ref](https://www.respondent.io): This is, by far, the revenue stream I reveived the most feedback and messages on. As I explained in my last post, this site allows users to take screening questionairres that will qualify them for very high paying focus groups or one-on-one webcam interviews. I can't give specefics due to NDA's, but I can say that I have made $200 in one hour going through a drive-thru and ordering food, $30 in 30 minutes for talking about shopping habits, and $180 for discussing taxes. I have been using this site for roughly five months, have taken over 200 qualifying surveys (each takes a few minutes), and have been selected for 18 of them. So far, I have made about $1,600 and average about $80/hr. (maybe more- I admittedly have not tracked invested time to the minute). I received a few messages asking about qualifications that are needed to do this one. Honestly, there are a lot of the focus groups that want doctors or dentists or lawyers. Fortunately for us, there are also a bunch that do not require making six figures a year. I went through today and have found a bunch that some of us would qualify for. This includes [$250 in-home study for phone savvy users in SF](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5ac7f2fd8c9c4500a694e00a/copy-of-smartphone-users-who-are-most-savvy-among-their-friends/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), [$100 for hourly workers in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5aba6a3ccd3d1000a04e7f66/higher-education-study/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), [$100 for people that bought a Dell laptop in 2018](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5a9eda3fcc2d06001e753629/seeking-new-dell-pc-owners/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), [$125 for HBCU students](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5abaa04814fbc7010ed213f7/hbcu-students-2018/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), [$125 on energy usage](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5a94343c772d42024454fda0/energy-usage/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), or [$200 for plumbers](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5a7de842bfc82601902ec501/seeking-plumbers/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d). There are literally hundreds of other opportunities and tests to take on there. It is definitely worth a look. \n\n>[Secret shopper app](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=roberthW77D): This link will take you directly to a sign-up page with my ref code. Feel free to delete it before signing up, if you want. Once registered, you will be taken to the app store where you can download the actual app on your mobile phone. I have not use this app that much, but can verify that they do indeed pay out. Essentially, you go to local stores near you that are identified in the app and take pictures or videos of specific items. I like this one because I have the ability to make a few extra bucks if I am already out and about or shopping at a specific store. The pay for this one averages about $15/hr.\n\n>[UsabilityHub](https://www.usabilityhub.com): This one lets the user take quick one or two minute surveys on your opinion of an app screen. They pay for this averages to about $.10 a minute, so it is nothing spectacular. Just leave it open in another tab and take a quick survey when you hear a new one come available. This will probably net you about $20 a month, but the time investment is so minimal it tends to be worth it for me. The only problem with this site is that you can't cashout until your balance hits $10. \n\n>Well, that is all I have for this post. I will try to continue to document different revenue streams that I come across and find work. As always, feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Good luck everyone!",

        "text": "Good news for all the Math nerds out there. You can earn some good cash by teaching mathematics and solving basic and advanced math problems. Those who have some previous tutoring experience are going to love this list because the websites have a  very decent rate for your tutoring time.\n\nYou don't need to be a Computer Wiz to work for these websites. All you need is a PC with a reliable Internet connection and you're good to go.\n\nHere's the list of websites:\n\n* **Yup.com**: Yup.com is an amazing online tutoring platform that allows you to teach Math, Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry and Probability to students online. You can create your own work schedule. They pay via **Direct Deposit** and **Paypal**.\n* **Study.com**: Study.com pays you to answer basic and advanced math questions and problems. Your answered will be reviewed before they are published so quality matters a lot. Payments are made twice in a month.\n* **Preply**: Preply is a general online tutoring platform but they have a dedicated section for Mathematics. They claim that their average tutor earns around $550 per week. That's a really good figure if you ask me. They pay via **Skrill**, **Paypal** and **Payoneer**.\n* **Math Cash Android App**: This isn't really a teaching platform. It's more like a multiplayer mobile game that expects you to solve a given number of puzzles in a short span of time. You will be competing with other players from all over the world. If you win, you will get cash prizes. I know it's not a steady source of income but it will keep you entertained while earning some pocket money. Payment method is **Paypal**.\n\nDo share your experiences with these apps if you have any. More details about these platforms can be found in the [Source List](https://www.webemployed.com/make-money-with-mathematical-skills/).",

This raised a flag as I read that the standard is to print out the check. \n\nSo i asked the guy for identifying information. He sends me a photo id of himself, but its the same photo on the google hangouts but a different name. I asked him for company id and he said i have nothing to worry about.  I responded to please send me a screen shot of him logged into appen or a company sent email photo and he has not responded so now I am concerned my drivers lic and photo of my social security card could be in the hands of an impersonater and my identity was just stolen or is this legit the way they send the money for the conputer and phone and programs?",

Just like Priceline for hotels, this is a way to see what all sites (including Amazon) will pay for your book, it also has a watchlist so you can remember which books you've searched for without typing in the IBSN over and over again. \n\nEvery single one of these sites has an average of a $15 requirement in order to even be able to check out with them. Most of these sites do not tell you this until you've already tried to check out with them. \n\nThrough all the frustration I found SellBackYourBook and Powell's wanted more of my books than the other sites. SBYB has only a $7.50 requirement while Powell's has an $8.99 or 8 book requirement. Both of these sites offer you store credit if that's more your speed.\n\nFair warning, Powell's has a pretty outdated site and if you're only adding IBSNs as you go, your session will time out and your buyback offer will disappear leaving you to start back at square one. I'd recommend having a running list of all the IBSNs you've decided you'd like to sell to Powell's and then copying and pasting into their appraisal bar. (Source: did that one too many times.)\n\nIn my opinion, sticking with these two sites will save you so much time but if you're adamant about checking for the best price, Bookscouter is the way to go.",

As the years have gone by, I find myself sleeping in later (I make my own hours) and working shorter hours because I don't like working past a certain hour. How do you guys get yourselves out of bed at a decent hour (I'm talking like 6:00, 7:00 a.m.) and remain disciplined as far as time management goes? I feel like I need a kick in the rear. I'm upset at myself because I used to be great at this. Depression and anxiety is a bitch, I suppose.",

LOL Seriously though, I think everyone struggles with motivation at times, whether you're working remotely or on-prem.\n\nI don't have to, but I do set an alarm for 8:15. Not as early as you're looking to rise and shine, but I'm fine with working later into the evening. I have my routine of breakfast, workout, shower, and then work. Give yourself some sort of structure.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with allowing yourself breaks. Breaks really benefit my productivity in the long run. So I'll set a mini goal for myself (work for 1 hour, complete this project, etc) and then \"reward\" myself with a short break to watch YouTube or creep Reddit.\n\nI also have daily goals for time spent and money earned. I use an iPhone app called Streaks to keep track of those goals (and personal ones as well). My work day doesn't end until I've met those goals. Of course there are extenuating circumstances, but my desire to check off my to-dos is powerful.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, find a healthy way to manage your depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed with the same issues and know how apathetic and listless they can leave you feeling. Find a treatment plan that works for you, whether it's medication, therapy, or something else.",

I use different points of the day (sunrise, noon, 4:20 midday \"prayer\", sundown) as guideposts, and do a specific meditation/rite/salute for each.\n\nIn between those guideposts, I assign myself my mundane tasks that absolutely have to be completed before the next phase of the day.

You stick to it even when that twinge of pressure forms from anticipatory anxiety which then turns to procrastination. \n\nI know this all too well, and have tried to decipher this innate lazines I get, and that's the best I have come up with so far, is to constantly remind myself...*discipline* alas I am the queen of never wanting to do shit ever.",

        "text": "[Crosspost from r/povertyfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/?utm_source=reddit-android)\n\nI put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).\n\nFull post:\n\nTime investment required for these numbers: 30-40 hours a week. Feel free to work less or more. 40 hours a week is only a requirement if you want to make over $1,000 following this guide.\n\nTech required for these numbers: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), and an internet connection. Alternatively, just go to the library a few hours a day.\n\nThis is a slightly modified and edited post that I made on another sub. I know that when I was trying to improve my life, working online opened a lot of additional doors for me. I was able to eat when I wanted instead of when I could afford it, I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner, and have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates.\n\nWorking online is something that pretty much anyone can do. If you are already browsing Reddit, you have the tools to make additional income. I am including payment proof as well as direct links to all of the sites, so everyone can see that it is actually possible and get started today. These are all legit sites and I have not been scammed or jipped by any of them for any amount. Feel free to do your own research about their trustworthiness if need be. \n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive guide to everything you can do online to make extra cash, nor is this really that impressive a number to make. This does not include some of the more well known sites like swagbucks or earnhoney, as I just do not like them that much. It does not include sites like Rat Race or Appen. It also does not include tutoring Chinese kids with some of the well known sites. This is more a quick overview of how I personally boosted my monthly income by almost $1,000 a month working with six different websites. While I am in America, many of these sites can be used worldwide. Hopefully someone can find a new revenue stream through this write-up.\n\nThe times I have invested vary greatly, from one or two hours a day to well over 12 hours a day. I average somewhere around $6.25 an hour (admittedly never giving it 100% attention),  but to me that is better than making nothing an hour. While it may seem excessive some days, I actually enjoy making money and I do some of it while I am at my day job, so it has become more of a time filler than actual work. Everyone will have their own experience but these are what have worked the best for me, either in time investment or having a little fun along the way.\n\n**Prolific.ac** ([$120](https://imgur.com/LJBrl0O)): Based in the UK, this is one of my favorites because they pay in Great British Pound (GBP) which is the equivalent to 1.4x the USD. Prolific is similar to mturk in that all you do is fill out surveys. Pay is better than mturk, but the availability of surveys is not as great. The initial questionnaire you have to fill out is a bit long taking me about 20 minutes, but ensures you qualify for every survey they show you and will never get disqualified for not meeting the demographic. You have to hit £5 before you can cash out, but you get this after a few days of watching for surveys. Leave it open in a tab and check it throughout the day. I wish I could do this one all day because the pay rocks, but I only see a few a day. They pay out in PayPal anytime you request it and have a balance of over £5. [www.prolific.ac](https://www.prolific.ac/p?ref=O8LEJ7R6)\n\n**Mturk** ([$2,400](https://imgur.com/1EPHq64)): This is by far the one I spend the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved. www.mturk.com\n\n**Respondent.io** ([$1,300](https://imgur.com/a/ITb6G)): This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, [like this $100 study looking for Hispanics](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5aca8435caa8750023f1fad6/seeking-hispanics-for-an-online-bulletin-board/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), [this $150 study for professional photographers](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5ac54b567fb53301220748b8/business-insurance-for-photographers/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d), or [this $125 study for people with investment accounts](https://app.respondent.io/projects/view/5abe8c4a2eeacd00fe41eadd/seeking-those-with-investment-accounts/7 secondman-6cf3dc2d701d). I only average getting approved for the groups about 8% of the time (I have filled out about 200 screeners and have been selected for 17 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [www.respondent.io](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)\n\n**Usertesting** ([$600](https://imgur.com/sxUwXW8)): This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. www.usertesting.com\n\n**Redbubble** ([$60](https://imgur.com/wobuyuz)): [My store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/7secondman). After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, clocks, mugs, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. I have only been at this one for about two months, but see the potential it has. It also takes a good amount of upfront work before you see any dividends. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. www.redbubble.com\n\n**PlaytestCloud** ($150): This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal. No payment proof available as it is not all saved in one place. www.playtestcloud.com\n\n**Reddit subs**($400): From test driving cars, to doing homework, to rating businesses, these subs have been a catch all for when I have any extra time to go through them. Honestly, this has probably been the third best pay per hour of work out of everything, after Respondent and Prolific. I just wish there were gigs to find all day. Be careful not to get scammed here. Some people are just... something else. \n\nCheck out r/beermoney, r/workonline, r/slavelabour, and r/jobs4bitcoins. \n\nWell, that is all I have for now. I hope someone can get something from this. Feel free to share any other revenue streams you may have and feel free to ask any questions you may have. I will answer the best I can.",

        "text": "Hey Guys,\n\na while ago my brother in-law recommended me listening to music while working, after telling him I write online reviews for as a half-time job. He is a graphic designer and told me, that he feels much more creative when listening to music during work. I  tried listening to piano playlists the next day and wasn\\`t very convinced by his tip. I quickly felt tired and run out of energy, which was probably because of the slow and rather too relaxing songs. I ended up pausing the playlist and carried on working as usual. A few weeks later my brother in-law asked me whether the music helped me, and suggested listening to Lo-Fi music instead of classical music after explaining what happened. And it actually helped me!\n\nLately I write my reviews quite a bit quicker and time flies by while working. In addition to that I got more positive feedback than usual. I know this kind of post isn\\`t exactly what you usually read here, but because all of you work online too, I would suggest giving it a try.\n\nLet me know if it helped you too 😊\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5dhenjIqVyF0E9rDzsIzbd?si=Eqv67UQ4S-yJHU7IRqnXng](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5dhenjIqVyF0E9rDzsIzbd?si=Eqv67UQ4S-yJHU7IRqnXng)",

They supply the computer and equipment. This is not a temporary position. My particular position is chat-based, though most are phone-based. Chat based is possible if you keep searching.\n\nI found this position through Rat Race Rebellion. They have a website [here](http://ratracerebellion.com/) and a more frequently updated Facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/RatRaceRebellion/). There's no charge or membership or anything. They post positions similar to the one I've mentioned but also post about Lionbridge and Appen opportunities if that's what you're looking for.\n\nA lot of the opportunities here are more temporary or more \"beer money\" type opportunities so I wanted to post this for people looking for a more \"real job\" type scenario. Good luck to everyone. Let me know if you have any questions.",

        "text": "**We've closed the application process, and will now begin sorting through applications and contacting applicants. If you applied, you will hear back once a decision is made on your application.** \n\nHey r/WorkOnline! I'm the Customer Success Manager at 4PatientCare, and [we are hiring again](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/7gxdfu/were_hiring_again_at_4patientcare_awesome_remote/)! We've always had good luck finding awesome candidates through Reddit (I was hired from a Reddit post!) Check us out at [4PatientCare.com](https://4PatientCare.com).\n\nWe are looking to hire a Technical Support Agent.  Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).\n\nA little about us: we pride ourselves in a laid back, yet incredibly self-disciplined culture. Because our team is spread out all over the country (and sometimes the world), there's a high level of autonomy involved in all positions. This is a place for people who are willing to take on any challenge that comes their way. “That’s not in my job description” is not a phrase we believe in. We’re more of an “I’ll figure it out!” kind of team.\n\nTransparency and honest communication are highly valued, and we're constantly looking for new ways to improve (here are our [Glassdoor ratings](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-4PatientCare-EI_IE760463.11,23.htm)). We are co-workers, friends, nerds, and gif experts. We are the Dream Team.\n\nAlso don’t be fooled, we’re not a startup. We’ve been in business for nearly 20 years delivering more happiness to healthcare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we’re looking for:\n\n* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively. We do not micro-manage and we do not hand-hold. We strike a balance between giving enough training and direction so that you're not totally in the shark tank without a life vest, but oftentimes it'll be up to you to be proactive to problem-solve and get. things. done. If you're lost and without a map, do you wait for someone to notice and show you the way or do you actively reach out to get the direction you need to move forward?\n* A natural curiosity and a strong desire to learn. Do you thirst for knowledge and yearn to explore the unknown? Do you like to know how things are put together and what makes them tick?\n* The ability to roll with the punches in a dynamic work environment. Do you welcome change and thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing setting?\n* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art? Is an upset client someone you fear or just another opportunity to turn someone's frown upside down?\n* Strong organization skills and attention to detail. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day? Can someone throw ten tasks at you with specific instructions for each and trust that everything will get done and get done right?\n\nThe main responsibilities of 4PatientCare Technical Support Agents include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Setting up new clients and existing clients with their requested services.\n* Assisting with basic pricing changes that occur when clients request changes to their current services.\n* Taking incoming communications to support existing clients regarding issues, bugs, feature requests, and feedback.\n* Engaging with customers about those issues, bugs, and feature requests and managing expectations about when everything will be resolved.\n* Quantifying the importance of those issues/bugs, measuring feature request frequency, and advocating for the fixes users are finding most troublesome.\n* Understanding the direct impact our services and service have on our clients, and within the confines of our system, doing everything possible to benefit clients’ businesses.\n* Creating and updating support documentation as processes improve.\n* Assisting and training on tasks and areas that you have become proficient in.\n\nBasic Requirements:\n\n* Must be a US citizen and reside in one of the following states: AL, CA, CO, FL, GA, MA, NC, NV, NY, PA, or UT.\n* Must be fluent in English.\n* Must have a computer and a working Internet connection.\n\nCompensation:\n\n* $16/hour during initial training period, which lasts a minimum of 3 months.\n* $18/hour after graduating from training\n* Paid Time Off (up to 10 days a year), Paid Holidays Off (6 per year)\n* Monthly Health Insurance Reimbursement (up to $300 per month)\n* 401K\n* Weekly prizes at the Company Friday game... If you win :P\n\nThink you have what it takes? Then click the link below to apply.\n\n**We've closed the application process and will now begin sorting through applications and contacting applicants.

        "text": "TIFU! Don’t be like me. I have a Google Home device in my living room (wasn’t my choice, but i have a gadget obsessed partner). I had a teaching demo and interview with a Chinese English tutoring company yesterday. I spent tons of time preparing my office to be quiet and clean for the interview: locked my cats up, disabled the hourly chime on my clock, put any device that could make noise upstairs, etc. \n\nIn the middle of the teaching demo, my pretend student was singing a song, and the instructions said to have her do it twice. I said something like, “Great! Now let’s sing that one more time.” To my horror, as I start my student’s song back up, I immediately hear our Google Home assistant’s voice say from the other room saying, “Okay. Playing ‘One More Time’ by Daft Punk.” I sit there mortified and frozen as the student sang the song again and the first notes of Daft Punk start wafting out of the space behind me. The song she’s singing drowns it out until the bass line hits. Then there’s nothing I can do to hide it. I want to crawl under my desk and unplug my computer and scream IS THIS REALLY MY LIFE but i manage to get it together and blurt out, “I’m so sorry, there’s an alarm going off in my other room, can i pause to disable it?” Then I run offscreen to do the worst possible thing during an interview other than, like, lifting my leg and farting onscreen. \n\nThe sweet and awesome interviewer still advanced me to the next stage, but I thought I was totally fucked. \n\ntl;dr: Your smart home assistant might ignore you when you’re two inches away screaming at it to turn on lights or look something up on Wikipedia, but it sure as hell will pick out the name of a popular dance track from the ‘00s said from across the house in the context of a totally different meaning and turn your best-laid plans for professionalism to shit. \n\nActual tl;dr: Throw away your smart home assistants because they’re plotting to ruin you.

But there was a job I noticed and applied for on Indeed that seemed 100% legit. Heard back from the one who posted to indeed who reviews resumes and said I was a good fit for their job which is just doing admin work. She then referred me to someone higher up, and gave me his email to forward my resume to. This was all in response to my actual job application and from a legitimate indeed email. \n\nI emailed the supposed person with my resume and heard back a couple days later. And then there came the scam. This was in response from the actual email I was referred to, and it even addressed the fact that I was referenced to him from that other person, using there name at all. I’ll copy + paste parts of this email and this is what you should look for in a scam.\n\n“5. Making charitable donations on my behalf\n\nI will maintain a fair degree of flexibility in terms of working around your other commitments. I will provide a clear set of instructions for each task I need to be done and sufficient funds to cover all errands.”\n\n\n“I am currently in China meeting with partners. I will be back in 2 weeks to arrange a formal interview with you and for the necessary paperwork. You will be receiving details of errands for you to help me within the next week (I have pending charitable donations, flights and travel to arrange).”\n\nThe entire email was well written, has an introduction, etc. But—if an employer is saying they’ll send you funds to make donations and such, that is where it is 99% a total scam. Just smells so fishy to me! I’m surprised I didn’t get an invite for google hangouts yet lmao but I’m sure that’ll come if I emailed him back with the info about me he wanted.\n\n",

So I checked what the buyer wrote me and indeed I indirectly saw that she wanted to use the article she ordered for academics. After seeing that I wanted to be very careful on my orders so I don't get a penalty. And then 3 days later I find out one of my customers with a big order is doing the same thing. The order was made with milestones a week before and it was supposed to last for 2 more. And this was a huge order, and I did a milestone already, so I didn't know what to do. So I decided to contact the customer support and they said they can't help me, I can just ask for mutual cancellation and receive no money and suffer with rating. Then I told them that it is not fair, I could have said nothing, but I did not want a penalty and I want to obey the Fiverr policy so I want to cancel the order but I don't want to get demoted because of it. After a few messages, they cancelled it without it affecting my rating. And I took that, without the milestones paid and without it affecting rating. However, a few hours later I receive a penalty for doing someone's academic work and I get demoted because of it. And after I complained that I literally reported the guy to not get a penalty they acted like that doesn't matter. And 2 ays later I saw it affected my completion rate!\n\nI know Fiverr is customer oriented, but c'mon I literally reported the customer going against Fiverr policy and I get punished? How does that make sense??? I am so pissed. And I've been stuck in a loop with them trying to make them undo what was unfairly done. I even said the demotion and warning can stay, I just want my completion rate to be back to 100% as it was, and they're still making me suffer for my honesty. I tried being honest and I got punished. Fiverr seriously needs to treat sellers better!",

I had been working off of Fiverr for the past few years and while it's a great start in the world of freelancing, I don't think it's a long term relationship. Fiverr has also found a way to screwing me a few times in the past, such as disabling a gig without giving me a reason, or cycling between level one and level two seller status in the course of HOURS and getting my email inbox spammed with notifications, or having customer support put my account put into vacation mode without notifying me after a job with a unreasonable client went sour.\n\nFrustrating as hell but if you're trying to build a portfolio and get freelance experience, it's a great start. I hope you manage to get through this without too much mental fatigue. Best wishes and good luck.",

        "text": "After applying to Joy Anderson Consulting (\"JAC\") for a “Customer Service Phone Evaluator” position via their web site instruction at [http://joyandersonconsulting.com/](http://joyandersonconsulting.com/), JAC responded via email that I must first do a \"Trial Call\" for a job to start immediately  to evaluate a  health insurance company rep.  JAC's \"Trial Call\" email stated, among other things, \"If they quote less than what you currently have in place feel free to take advantage of it, as we have had calls like that happen and saved people money on their health insurance. ...\"  The \"Trial Call\" to 844-523-0929 took more than the 5-10 minutes JAC stated.  After emailing the results of the \"Trial Call\" to JAC ([hr@joyandersonculting.com](mailto:hr@joyandersonculting.com)), JAC immediately emailed \"Compilation and evaluation of all trial calls will take approximately 2 to 3 weeks as we have to individually access each and every trial call made. If you do not hear back from us within three weeks, unfortunately it means your trial call was not successful.\" JAC never contacts back after the \"Trial Call.\"\n\nThe \"Trial Call\" cost me time and resources, and surreptitiously put me on a call list from 866-221-3431 to buy health insurance.  JAC contacts were Lara Walton, HR Manager and Demi Fletcher, Assistant HR Manager.\n\nAccording to Google search, JAC \"prevented Google from creating a page description, but didn't actually hide the page from Google.\" See also Google search for [annemillerconsulting.com](http://annemillerconsulting.com/) (\"AMC\").\n\nIn fact, JAC and AMC are websites that defraud job seekers into performing phone evaluations for free for Go Health ([https://www.gohealthinsurance.com](https://www.gohealthinsurance.com)) and possibly Care360 ([https://get.care360.com/](https://get.care360.com/)), turns in the job seeker's evaluation as their own, and gets paid for the phone evaluation they did not perform.  This employment scam also enables JAC and AMC to underhandedly sell and/or get customers to switch their health insurance.  See also [https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/blrjg1/another\\_example\\_of\\_the\\_consulting\\_scam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/blrjg1/another_example_of_the_consulting_scam/)\n\nThe Craigslist ads usually have a displayed link that points to a different link -- see [https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/lbg/d/atlanta-based-in-atlanta-remote-work/6986514630.html](https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/lbg/d/atlanta-based-in-atlanta-remote-work/6986514630.html)   and   [https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/lbg/d/atlanta-155-per-day-atlanta/6987177492.html](https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/lbg/d/atlanta-155-per-day-atlanta/6987177492.html).",

I dont think I have many skills, my girlfriend at some point suggested I should become a YouTuber/twitch streamer but i wouldn't know where to begin for that she says I'm entertaining but that's the biased opinion of a girlfriend, bevause I am boring af in my own opinion.\nAnd as for streaming my internet wouldn't be able to handle that just barely 3 mb/s connection won't help me hold a stream i think.\nBeing in mexico all i need is 15 to 30 dollars a day minimum to live a decent life, I hope I can achieve that somehow.\n\nI've been looking at sites such rat race rebellion and survey sites but most of these offers I dont qualify for either for lack of experience or for living in mexico.\n\nAny suggestions that could be useful?.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "title": "Update: It has been a Very Profitable Month Making Money Online With UserTesting",
        "text": "About a month ago I posted on reddit about making $150 in one day with UserTesting. As a lot of other people who use the site mentioned, its unrealistic to expect to make that much in one day on a regular basis. However, after a month (minus a week where I didn't go on UserTesting at all) I have made $750.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on this, I will reiterate what I said in that post. User Testing seems to be in higher demand right now. People who claim they aren't getting too many tests approved just aren't putting in the time to establish themselves on the website. UserTesting works to ensure quality work gets submitted to the clients, and it is hard to trust someone with too many tests when they don't have an established history of tests with good ratings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA bit of advice also:\n\nI found that Tuesdays are the days I make the most money. I made $120 on Tuesday this week. Just keep on trying to get approved for tests and they will slowly start increasing in numbers. Be patient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am wondering if anyone else with an established test history that has found this amount of success on the site? What do you guys think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'll add the link here for people who need it.\n\n[Usertesting](https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester)\n\nAlso a post on what UserTesting is and how to get started here:\n\n[How to become a user tester](https://www.thebrokemansblog.com/2019/02/usability-testing-what-is-it-and-how-do.html?m=1)\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "**tl;dr - got laid off, expecting a baby girl any minute now, need advice on how to make an extra $35/day ($7,400/year) from home**\n\nI hate troubling people, but this one is important. My boss passed away and the company was sold to another who ended up laying off 95% of the work force. They kept me on long enough to get the rest of the info / documents before calling me with the oh-so-pleasant, \"Hello, we have HR on the phone as well.\" Sob story over. \n\nToward the end of my time there, I started broadcasting on Twitch. Currently, I'm about $35/day ($7,400/year) short. In addition to that, I'm trying to make ends meet by transcribing with Rev.com, but it's just not cutting it with the amount of time I'm putting into it. In order to simplify things at home, we sold one of our cars, so leaving the house for something would be difficult especially with my wife going back to school in a few months, a 7 year old at the house, and a newborn.\n\nI'm looking for any tips, advice, ideas... anything at this point to help bridge the gap. I have a number of skills including some basic/light programming, probably not good enough to put on a résumé. I can learn more if needed or maybe get certified if need be. This is the first month that I've had to dodge calls before the bills can get paid and I hate it. I feel like I've failed and I'm drowning. I've done my time in sales and banking and I'll do almost anything to not have to go back to that. But, of course, I'll do anything to make sure my family's taken care of.\n\nI feel like I've stared at Monster, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, and Craigslist for days without anything substantial jumping out. I've been around reddit for years (throwaway account, but DMs are open) and I've seen some amazing responses. If that happens here, I'll be forever grateful. If not, at least I know I tried. Thank you so much for reading this.",

The doing away with the physical overhead alone can and does save companies millions of dollars as well as allows them to hire and retain talent that might not be readily available in the physical location they are located in.\n\nHaving taken advantage of that already and gotten used to things the way they are, these greedy chicken littles are bitching because someone noticed they are putting a strain on the social fabric of our labor force and they don't want to be made play by the same rules as every other provider of labor. FUCK EM. They will adapt.\n\nAs for companies like Uber, Lyft, and all other taxi services if you are in your vehicle and available for work, then you should be paid for that time whether the company is utilizing you or not. It is the responsibility of the employer to fully utilize their employees, not the problem of the employee who came to work for one reason, to get paid to pay the fucking bills.",

I see a lot of people writing a lot of positive things which are mainly true but also don't tell you about the down sides, so here we go!!\n\nI've almost completed my first 6 months with DaDa I started in May 2019. The reason I started teaching English online is so I could be with my fiance who is from Mexico. We have tried to get her to Australia where I live but have had immigration problems, anyway! I'm making around $1200USD a month and hoping to get closer to $2,000USD in the coming months. \n\nIf you live in America or South America be prepared to sacrifice sleep! You will be working from 6pm-9pm Beijing time Monday - Friday and on the weekends (all day Beijing time). In Australia you will be working in the evenings and UK in the afternoons I believe.\n\nThe good thing about Dada is that they give you students, parents dont pick. Like they do in Vipkid. I hear there are over 70,000 teachers on Vipkid and a lot of teachers are lucky to make $200 in their first month. My first month with DaDa I made $875USD!! It took me a week in the first month to teach my first formal class. But from there on wards I was getting bookings like no tomorrow! I'm not sure how many teachers DaDa has...but going on the ranking system it could be around 10,000 or so. Thats just a guess!!! I really dont know. \n\n# Students\n\nThe students are all in all pretty good! I have had two students who have gone to the bathroom while I was teaching them.I just covered my camera and told them they didn't need to bring their Ipad with them to the bathroom. They can go to the bathroom and come back to the class after. I've had one student who absolutely hates learning English, sometimes I get into the classroom and he is there crying and screaming. I dont have him anymore thank goodness! I've also had parents who hit their children when making a mistake or not paying attention, this is just part of their culture, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do. Just be aware that you will most likely see a child get hit by their parent from time to time.\n\n# Classes\n\nThe Formal lessons are 30mins long and you will have only 2 minutes in between classes if you have back to back. So, if you have a class at 5am EST time you will finish your class at 5:30am. But your next class starts at 5:32! So really you only have about 1 and a half minutes to get into the next class! Sometimes the system you teach on is laggy! So I've been in class with just 10 seconds before it starts! If you're late you will lose your $1 on time bonus and if you're more than 3 minutes late you will get a $18 fine for a class you would have made $10 for doing! Chinese online companies have very strict fines and penalties.\n\nTeaching for 30mins doesn't seem like a long time but believe me you need a lot of energy for this job! With DaDa only having 2 minutes between classes means you wont be even able to go to the bathroom until you have a small break. So, if you have 6 classes in a row its 3 hours without any time to do anything. Also the 30mins you need to be switched on and a I mean really switched on. Parents will complain if you have low energy in the classroom or even if you yawn. So if you're not an energetic person make sure you take breaks or load up on coffee. \n\nOf course you dont have to act like a clown like you see some youtubers do, thats a bit extreme. It is important to have some props! Dont over do it! I personally use Manycam and I literally use just a teddy bear for the young children I have, thats it. Just make sure you have fun while teaching :) \n\nBeware of over doing it as well! 6 classes doesn't seem like a lot but thats 3 hours you have to be in the zone for and all energetic and smiling. Take it easy until you're comfortable with teaching and then add more slots gradually.\n\n# Avoid burnout/fatigue\n\nI find having a \"why\" really helps me get through the classes. Why do I want to do 8 classes everyday and 10 classes on the weekend? For me its to pay for my wedding. For you it might be to pay off some debt! Student loans, car payments or a house loan. Maybe its to afford a family holiday. Just make sure you have a \"why\" to avoid burnout or fatigue.\n\n# How leave works\n\nI personally think leave with Dada has improved a lot recently! I travel a lot. I've been to Cuba, Australia and Mexico since I started with Dada and have had no problems getting leave off. I'm currently in Mexico and heading back to Australia in one week!\n\nLong term leave is only available for teachers on DaDa who have done more than 6 months with the company. You are allowed 30 days off I believe.\n\nShort term leave is now based on how many regular students you have. I have around 25 regular students which allows me to have 17 hours leave in September! Which is great! I'm able to spend two days flying back home while using my leave for Dada without any problems. The more regular students you have the more short leave you get!\n\nI find it really easy to travel with this job! So if you're a digital nomad don't be afraid! It's very possible to do online teaching and travel at the same time. Just make sure you have good internet at the place you're going to be staying. Simply ask the Airbnb or hotel/hostel to do a speedtest before hand!\n\n# Best way to receive payment!\n\nAlso about payment! For Existing online and future online teachers, I recommend using transferwise to receive payment, you pay a lot less than paypal in fees. Paypal you pay 4.4% and transferwise you pay something like 0.5% in fees! Get a boarderless account. A lot of people are using transferwise now as you dont lose as much money as you would from direct debit or paypal when you get paid. Once your money is in your borderless account you can transfer it to your normal bank account without any problems :)\n\nI really hope this has helped all who have taken the time to read this :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReferral code  [https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing?referrer=M5G5F5L5K505](https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing?referrer=M5G5F5L5K505)\n\nNon Referral code  [https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing](https://www.dadaabc.com/teacher/landing?referrer=M5G5F5L5K505)",

That said the amount of leave available looks like it's nearly one w/e a month which is pretty reasonable.",

        "text": "I am going to share a list of 4 websites that allow you to make money by writing software reviews. This is a great opportunity, especially for IT related people who use multiple software in their job roles and businesses.\n\nJust like you'd review a physical product, you can write an honest and impartial review about a software that you've used and are familiar with. Usually these websites pay in the form of Gift cards. You can redeem / exchange those cards for money of course.\n\nHere's the list:\n\n1. **Capterra**: A software reviews based platform where you can find info about your favorite software. They pay around $50 to $150 for each review. Payment methods are **Paypal** and **Gift cards**.\n2. **Gartner**: One of the most popular IT solutions provider. You will earn a **$10 Visa gift card** for every review you publish. The card can be exchanged into multiple currencies.\n3. **G2Crowd**: Another software reviews based company. You can earn a **$5 Starbucks card** or a **$10 Amazon gift card** for your reviews.\n4. **ApperWall**: A reviews based application that pays you to test and review different Android and iOS apps. You earn $1 for each review. A nice way to supplement your income.\n\nYou can find more details about these apps and their links in this [Article](https://www.webemployed.com/earn-money-software-reviews/). Somehow the post gets removed when I link those websites here. Do let us know if you've used any of these websites. Also if you can add other platform that you've used for similar purpose, that would be great.",

I make about 200 dollars a week which barely pays for my monthly expenses.   \n\n\nRecently I asked for a 15% raise so I could have a little bit more money left each month to save up or for an emergency fund. Long story short, they denied the raise because \"the company is not making enough money\".  \n\n\nSo right now I'm looking for alternatives working online and making at least 1,000 dollars a month so I can leave that job.  I'm an engineering dropout with 5 years experience in 2D and 3D design (AutoCAD, Inventor, SolidWorks) working in the HVAC, Aerospace and wood industry so any suggestions in that field would be great.  \n\n\nI'm also fluent in english and spanish, can read, write and translate to both languages. Also, my girlfriend is a US citizen and I could use her documents to work online ( I have her consent, I don't know if this is legal, though).  \n\n\nThank you for reading me and hope you have a great weekend :)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

Try dog walking/pet sitting.\n* Can you downsize your lifestyle or rent out a room to cut down on housing expenses?\n* What about Uber Eats or Door Dash? There's still some getting out of the house and human interaction but it's a lot less than a standard food service job and much more flexible.\n* Have you contacted your utility providers and advised them of your situation? Many will offer you a reduced rate or at least a budgeted plan to keep costs lower.\n* In the same vein, have you emailed your local job resource (unemployment office? maybe?) to see if they have any resources to help you? \n* Same for mental health resources. You don't need to grind through mental health issues **alone**. You can seek help. If you don't know who to contact, try asking around your local online groups. Even yard sale groups can be surprisingly helpful.\n* Learn to coupon, if you haven't already. It's not like the TV shows, but it's also way more than saving 5 cents on a tomato. I save several thousand dollars a year on food, shampoo, paper products, etc. It's a little daunting at first but I always recommend people start with one or two stores, and 5 or less staple items. Then watch the sale cycles, and the coupon inserts (and the rebate apps if you're really motivated!) to score lots of stuff for cheap or free. \n\nBest of luck.",

Wanted more of a career and the ability to work from home. Someone recommended PalFish to me which accepts TESOL certifications if you don’t have a degree. Try looking on Groupon for a discounted certification so you don’t have to pay hundreds of dollars. They pay between 16-22 an hour and the classes fill up pretty quick apparently. You’ll teach Chinese kids between the ages of (I believe) 5-12 English. The hours are extremely flexible and you can pick your own schedule. The classes are 1 on 1  for 25 minutes with the students with no parent interaction. You just have to make sure you’re cheerful and outgoing. I would research a lot beforehand and make sure you follow all the rules for submitting your application/interview. The interview is just a video submission and you also have to fill out your profile and get accepted. It’s a career that’s in demand and as long as you don’t mind that it’s a pretty solitary job, that it’s flexible (meaning you could have tons of classes booked or none booked), and it’s done by phone/tablet and you have the space for it, you should be good to go. The requirements are that you have a certification or degree and that you’re from a European country and speak fluent English. Hope this helps.",

I also work with GoTranscript where I submitted more than 250 transcriptions with an average score of 4.9/5\n\nBased on the task count and my own work I'm currently the only one working on those tasks from OneSpace and there only seem to be mainly one reviewer. About 80% of all tasks submitted come back to \"rework\" with always the exact same phrase telling me to check my spelling. I almost lost my mind the first few times since that never happened before and I searched and searched and searched for mistakes, I even asked friends to proofread. There were no mistakes. So i submit the task again with no changes to let it review by another person and 100% of the time this person approves the task with no problem at all.\n\nThis makes me so pissed because a task marked as \"rework\" needs to be reworked in 2 hours after review, otherwise I won't get paid. If I transcribe it at 3 PM and said person happens to review it at 1 AM I miss the deadline if I don't want to get up in the middle of the night  and lose all of the money for this tasks for absolutely nothing!\n\nOneSpace, please change that system of approval!",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been a teacher with SayABC for about 7 months.  SayABC is a Chinese company which allows you to teach 4 young students online.\n\nHere is my income proof for [November](https://imgur.com/wC6llG6) ($2,190USD) and for [April](https://imgur.com/v6Hqi7b) ($1,299USD). My point is that you have control over how much you want to work and earn. In November I used to work 7 days a week. Since February I decided I only wanted to work 4 days per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEach class is 40 minutes long. The classroom time-slots for weekdays are:\n\n18:00 BJT\n\n18:50 BJT\n\n19:40 BJT\n\n20:30 BJT\n\nThere are two extra night spots on the weekends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in Toronto Canada, so that translates to 6:00am-9:10am shifts. I earn about $19USD per class, and make a total of $76USD every morning (I have 4 classes). For me, this is a great way to subsidize income on top of my regular, 40 hour day job. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to have the following qualifications;\n\n* Bachelors degree to work as a teacher (doesn't matter if you went to school for teaching or not. Your degree can be in anything)\n* TEFL or TESOL. TEFL and TESOL can be pretty easy to get through Groupon (which is what I did)\n* Decent internet connection (anything above 20mbps, you will be fine)\n* Native English speaker\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have control over how many slots you can open and close. It can take a few weeks to get classroom bookings. I have a conspiracy theory that the company watches your classes once in a while and bases classroom bookings based on your performance in the class. TPR is very important, and sometimes I feel like more of an entertainer than a real teacher. For the most part, this is the going theme in all these English teaching companies. However, I must say it is much easier to keep 4 students engaged than just 1 student. The classrooms are small enough that they don't get out of control, and big enough that the kids entertain themselves and keep each other accountable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hiring process recently changed for SayABC where you don't get a mentor teacher during the on-boarding. Here is the process as I understand it (will update if I find more information):\n\n1. Sign up on their website and submit your applications \n2. Once your application becomes approved, you have a Skype interview with a representative of the company. You will have to do a 10 minute 'mock' class where you have to pretend the interviewer is a student.\n3. You are then booked for an evaluation class with 4 real students. Your class will be recorded and you will be evaluated on it. If you pass the evaluation, you are hired! (You will be paid $15 for this class by the way!)\n\nThe hiring process took me about 3 weeks to complete when I went through it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere used to be a teacher mentor session where an established teacher would mentor and advise you. Now those sessions have been phased out. If you are nervous about the interview or the evaluation class feel free to Skype me: *live:x430250.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis summer SayABC will be having 'summer camps', which means you are more likely to be booked more quickly than otherwise (again, it can take a few weeks to have your homerooms fill up).\n\nThe summer camps will run as follows:\n\n* July 15-July19\n* July 22-July26\n* August5-August9\n* August12-August16\n\nThe camps will run on three different timeslots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I must add that the SayABC curriculum is really good. You don't have to prepare much content - everything is already there for you to use! You only need to get some props (which can be objects of realia that you get around your house, or printed pictures).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested in working at SayABC here are the links;\n\nNon-Referral Link: [https://t.sayabc.com/recruit.html#/apply](https://t.sayabc.com/recruit.html#/apply)\n\nReferral Link: [https://t.sayabc.com/apply.html?source=1&via=REFERRAL&rc=E3IBQ5](https://t.sayabc.com/apply.html?source=1&via=REFERRAL&rc=E3IBQ5)\n\nMy Skype: live:x430250\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a great weekend! <3",

The only ones available for Venezuelans I've found pay too little and are not worth the effort. \n\nI'm not a professional, I had to drop out of university because of the political problems happening in my country. But I speak English and I have some experience with data entry jobs. Is there something out there I can do to make a decent income to survive while I study on my own to get a better job?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour suggestion would be of great help for me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw if anyone need help with translations or something like virtual assistance, let me know. Thanks for reading.",

But what about looking into being a middle man, since you speak English so well, and maybe making some sort of agency of some sort, like graphic design, or video editing or something on the computer that can be done remotely, and even if you don't personally have the tech skills, you do have the language skills.  \n\nIf you can gather a few friends that have the tech skills, then you can make a somewhat similar post saying that you are a team of ______ and explain the situation in Venezuela and that you really need work.  Just make sure to already have an easy way to collect money from other countries. If you make it easy, then I think you can get some decent money.  \n\n",

        "title": "Collection of great online opportunities in 2019",
        "text": "(Seems like I triggered the SPAM filter accidentally, reformatted a bit to see if that helped)\n\nI've posted a few guides here before and they're a bit outdated, so I thought I'd post a collection of the online opportunities I've seen that are still worthwhile and not defunct while briefly touching on some things that aren't really worth the effort at this point in time. Namely, I don't feel things like clickworker and other task-sites like microworkers are all that worth it anymore since there's not much on there. \n\n**Note:**\n\nAssume these are U.S. only unless explicitly stated otherwise. A lot of things on here are U.S. only but there are a few international ones that you may be interested in. Alternatively [my guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/4rjzxc/shibests_guide_to_making_30day_online_from_pretty/) for international individuals is still decent, I'd just try to add in as many things from this current guide as you can since they're a lot more recent. I'll be using the following terms (generally) to describe things:\n\n* International - available to everyone with no drawbacks\n* International but rates depend on country - available to everyone with potentially some favoritism to (likely) western countries\n* International/unsure or U.S./unsure - I'm not certain if it is one or the other but I believe it's one or the other.\n\n* **Reddit Subs (all international):**\n\n* /r/forhire\n* /r/hireawriter\n* /r/slavelabour (will likely be garbage rates, but worth monitoring if you really need the money. Some can be a decent $10+ an hour once in a blue moon. Saw one the other day that was basically \"edit my 2 page paper for $10\")\n* /r/HungryArtists\n* /r/hireaprogrammer (seems to be inactive but worth monitoring)\n\nIf anyone else knows of any freelance/remote job subs let me know and I'll append it above.\n\n* **Remote Job Opportunities (All or most U.S. only/unsure**\n\n* Apple At Home Advisor (https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/aha.html)\n* Xerox (https://www.xerox.com/en-us/jobs/work-from-home)\n* Teaching English online (Various, not going to give links because unsure of repute of each company - however Palfish is the name most thrown around here from what I've seen)\n* Amazon (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/virtual-locations)\n* Various other companies hire remote customer service reps in general, a lot do in fact. But you gotta dig through a bit to see who is currently hiring.\n\nGenerally these will have either educational requirements or citizenship (most likely U.S.) requirements. Remote positions are open elsewhere as well, but require a lot of digging.\n\n* Passive income online\n\nPassive income is a bit of a buzzword in my opinion. It's really more like \"some effort spaced around time where you don't put in effort\". This section will border a bit more on the \"save money\"/\"investment of money and time for possible passive income\" side of things.\n\n* Blogging (International but with drawbacks with certain forms of monetization)\n\nA bit overstated because you won't really make any money unless you attract a significant following but still worth mentioning. Obviously if you're struggling and can't afford your next rent payment you shouldn't be spending money on hosting or a domain. I've had moderate successes and total failures in this area. Only really worth doing if you have unique ideas and don't expect anything out of it.\n\n* Selling graphic design on sites like Zazzle (International/unsure or it depends)\n\nThere's a million of these out there. Redbubble, zazzle, sunfrog, etc. If you've got an eye for graphic design I'd give these a try. You basically just slap your design on merchandise and they handle everything else. Might be worth it to advertise to a following or generally promoting your designs.\n\n* Ebates [Ref](https://www.ebates.com/r/FULLME208?eeid=28187) [Non](https://www.ebates.com) (International/unsure)\n\nIf you do any online shopping there's really no reason not to use this. Basically you get 1-10+% back on pretty much any online store. If you install the plugin you can see the sheer amount of online stores where you can get an average of about 5% cash back on. Walmart, best buy, amazon, pretty much you name it. Especially great for the black friday/cyber monday deals coming up. Plus on your first purchase over $25 you get an extra $10. Basically, you get an average of about 5% cash back just for activating the browser plugin when the notification pops up when you're shopping online. Pretty much every online store I've been to had some cash back with Ebates.\n\n* Swagbucks [Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Zamininc) [Non](http://www.swagbucks.com) (International)\n\nBasically just switch your normal search engine over to Swagbucks and you'll passively get some swagbucks which can be converted into Amazon gift cards. Adds up over time. There's also really, really good offers to check before you make a subscription or a big purchase, sometimes doing it through swagbucks effectively lowers the price a lot. Like for example currently you can get $25 in swagbucks for signing up with hulu or $2.5 in swagbucks + $50 off with blue apron. Also you can get $205 in swagbucks if you become a lyft driver, which is probably the most exciting thing on there. If you're already planning on signing up for a service it might be worth it to check out if you can get anything on swagbucks for it.\n\n* Actual sites to work on\n\nGetting to the meat of this I've decided to split it up by type of work. All of these either make $6+ or are extremely likely to, and most are more than that. As I always have I'll stress that these likely aren't long term solutions. I mean, sites go down, become less profitable, and you might not always be able to support yourself on income from these. It's important to look for opportunities to freelance/work remotely as opposed to working on sites like these forever. That being said, these can be good in a pinch and as an addition to other forms of work.\n\n* **Misc Tasks**\n\n\n* [mTurk](https://www.mturk.com/) (U.S. and Canada?)\n\nHas always been a decent option for working online. I believe this is U.S. only, but I've heard of Canadians also getting accepted. Either way, it's worth a shot to try to get into. /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/ is your friend here.\n\n* [Clickworker](http://clickworker.com/) (International but rate depends on country)\n\nIt's kinda declined in the past couple years but it can still provide some decent, high quality work. Requires a lot of concentration and there's more work droughts than there are periods where there's steady work available. Worth a shot if you live in the U.S. or U.K. but I wouldn't bet my life on there being work available.\n\n* [Appen](https://appen.com/) (unsure, I believe U.S. only)\n\nMuch more of a formal job than the other two in this section. \n\n* **Survey sites (that are actually worth doing)**\n\n\n* Prolific Academic [Ref](https://www.prolific.ac/p?ref=HECETDIC) [Non](https://www.prolific.ac)\n\nI haven't personally had much luck with this one personally but I know a lot of people who have. It's worth checking out and from what I understand the surveys are much higher paying than on crummy survey sites you'll find shilled all the time on here.\n\n* Respondent.io [Ref](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11) [Non](https://app.respondent.io)\n\nNote: The referral link belongs to /u/SuperSecretSpare who also has posted some great guides here. I only found it through their posts and I felt it was only right to give them the credit for this.\n\nBasically respondent.io hosts a lot of well paying studies and focus groups. It's a bit more hands-on and some studies are even in person, but it's pretty well paying.\n\n* **Writing sites (Varies a lot, most are international to some extent though)**\n\n* [iWriter](https://www.iwriter.com/)\n* [Textbroker](https://www.textbroker.com/)\n\nAbove are two content mills that have actually paid out to me in the past. They're pretty much interchangeable and I'd say their rates are around ~$10/hr. Heavily don't recommend unless you can't freelance since that's way way under standard industry rate.\n\n* [Constant Content](https://www.constant-content.com/)\n* Contentgather [Ref](https://contentgather.com/r/9790) [Non](https://contentgather.com)\n\nThese two are sites where you can write articles about pretty much anything and sell them at a decent rate. Constant Content isn't accepting any new applicants to my knowledge and Contentgather can be slow (usually only a few articles sold/day, but it's up and coming). I've thrown up a few articles on Contentgather myself and haven't sold anything so far, so I'd say if you use it don't expect anything to sell within a month or so.\n\n* [whopayswriters](http://whopayswriters.com/)\n\nA pretty good resource for finding places to pitch to if you're going the freelance route.\n\nAdding the rest of the post seems to upset the spam filter, probably for length. So I'll post it in the comments. If any of it violates /r/workonline's rules or spam filter please message me and I'll remove it, but I don't think any of it does.",

Just my opinion, depends on what your skill set is.\n\nAlso, a survey site worth doing for Canadians is [legerweb.com](https://legerweb.com) I have made 100s over the past few years. Can only cash out in $20 increments. Options are a cheque mailed or a prepaid visa online. \n\nA really good international one (I know it is great for US and Canada, I'm unsure on other countries) is the app \"Streetbees\". I made 30 bucks from one survey once. They send what fits your profile so there are dry patches. Available for Ios or Android, just search \"Streetbees\" in your app store. Also as a bonus, it is paid in USD so for Canadians we get more, and it is direct payout after EACH survey to PayPal.",

However, I somehow failed both of them  despite studying and memorizing the guidelines carefully for over an hour.

        "text": " \n\nWeirdly enough, it looks like I can still be surprised after all. I guess I am not as old as I forced myself to think. I hope that’s a good sign. But why those surprising news always come so unexpected? It always seems like they strike you out of nowhere no matter how “ready” you are. This one got me off guard for sure.\n\nI know you know that I am an Upwork guy. I’ve been there for ages and I still remember those times when a simple “I want to work” on your profile could actually get you some work. Not supporting this idea since I believe in proper, not snobbish, presentation of your skills. And, I have to say, Upwork has come a long way from being a so-so platform to a gigantic and, I think, the one at the moment freelancing hub.\n\nChanges are for good. At least, that’s what they say. But for some reason I did not feel this way while watching Upwork grow. At first it seemed to me like the best freelancing platform role model and I was cheering for them non-stop by hooking up people to give it a try. 10% of contract fee seemed a lot but fair, clients felt relatively responsive, payment felt good. But at a certain point something went a different way that, somehow, surprises me every time. Let’s do some details.\n\n– Upwork changes their fee percentage from 10 to 20. Sure, you can cut it up to 5 but let’s be honest – that is a long way to go.\n\n– Upwork added connects and limited the number of invites you can send to apply for jobs. Out of connects? You can buy more or wait until next month.\n\n– Want to start working? Pass video verification, send documents and get banned if you do something wrong. By all means – security should be number one priority but sometimes it feels toooo secure.\n\n– Weirdly enough, with so many updates, people started claiming they are getting less invites/contracs and usually waste their connects for nothing. Sure, that can be deeply personal but with my 10 years of experience and 5 star feedback I rarely get responses from clients.\n\nAnd that is not all) Starting next month, that should be May, every connect will cost you 0.15 cents. Just like that – out of the blue – 0.15 cents! No free connects, no demo or whatever – just money. And this is super disappointing. Like 20% cut is not enough already!\n\nOk, I get it – you need to earn money and I am being realistic here – nothing goes for free. But after all – Upwork is not free. With so many deals being processed every day, I feel like Upwork has some great investments from people all over the world. And now this…\n\nHere is the first thing that disappoints me a lot:\n\nIf I, as a freelancer with 10+ years of experience, get close to none responses from clients for free, now I will get the same but for money. I am more than sure that with paid connects Upwork is not going to bring any guarantees to be hired. So, I already imagine me spending 5-10 dollars trying to apply for a job I want with no success. I came to earn money but instead I spend money. Nice. But not really.\n\nOn the top of that, when you apply for a job, it doesn’t cost just 1 connect but at least two. Upwork says it may vary from 2 to 10 depending on client’s request. So, a good contract-to-be might cost you 1.5$. Actually, I have nothing else to add here.\n\nNow, the only hope here is for the clients to invite you for the jobs but that is a so-so solution. I do understand that, probably, the best explanation for this is that untrustful freelancers are spamming clients with job applications and to avoid that a paid solution should be integrated. But, in the end, the good ones suffer.\n\nLet me know what you think about it cause I am pretty angry now and need to process it better. Not that it would help but still.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Original Post:** [Pay To Apply Era?

Kindness isnt a stable source of income though\n\nNow my goal is to be able to make 100$ a month. With that, we should be able to buy some food and I could even afford college\n\nThe biggest issues I face is that my internet speed is on average only 1mbps. Normally thats enough for most tasks, but video-related things, specially video calls can get pretty bad due to horrible ping. And I also only get 12 hours of electricity on average per day, so whatever it is that I do needs to have flexibility, as I could end up disconnecting at any moment\n\nGiven that, and knowing that I'm not from the US, what can I still do to make some money?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "Location: US\n\nBeen working remotely for companies for over 10 years as a remote tech, however was laid off 6 months ago and been unable to find new work doing the same type of work. \n\nI do have some medical problems which have gotten worse this year and while I can still work I can't : \n\n1. Work for long periods of time.  If I am feeling good I can get up to 4 hours at a stretch. \n\n2. I get severe migraines, which means that I need to be able to \"take a day off\" at a moments notice. \n\n3. Due to severe insomnia, can't do anything that requires waking up early so preferably something I can do in the evenings. \n\n4. If I can, would like to find something that my g/f (who has her own health problems) would be able to do as well. \n\nSo basically I need to be able to find something where I can work \"as able\" that does not require following a specific schedule. \n\nI have tried signing up for MTurk, which seems to be a feasible option, and am awaiting the invite.  \n\nIs there anything else similar that could give me the flexibility needed?  \n\nWith my limitations, what is the feasibility in being able to make $200 /week ?",

I have a high school diploma and I'm currently studying International Relationships at Uni. I think I'm pretty decent at writing, even some of my teachers praised me on my writing skills. I've been living in Italy for more than 12 years but the language I prefer to write in is English. Languages and writing are two things I'm pretty passionate about and I am trying my best to find a way to make some money while studying, you know, put that early foundation.\n\nI'm proficient in English (C1, with certificate), Italian and Romanian, I also know Spanish basics ( I could be pretty good with a couple of weeks of hard study, which I'm totally fine with doing). I'm planning on learning Chinese.\n\nI have tried a few methods\n\nFiverr: Translation and writing gigs have been active for months and no orders so far.  \nUpwork: Maybe because I don't have any past experiences, or maybe because it's clogged but my application has been rejected twice already.  \nBlog: I created a blog with a pretty good niche I'd say (fashion and health) but after 2 years of simply paying the hosting service for less than 100 visitors every month ( probably my mom and friends spamming f5 on their many devices ) I just quit. The SEO was pretty good and I even hired some good writers to write a few posts \"professional-style\" but it didn't actually bring any new visitors.  \nClickworker, and other survey websites: Maybe it's because of where I live or I really have no idea, I made maybe 50 Euros over a year despite checking regularly for new surveys.  \nIwriter: please...\n\nI've been following these \"rich\" influencers / YouTubers with their affiliate marketing, dropshipping and lambo in the back but honestly, I'm too scared to try those methods, I have no money to invest right now. The tutorials feel like a catch for them to make even more money. The usual \"Wait till the end of the video to find out this secret.\"\n\n  \nHow do I get experience? How can I make a name for myself?\n\nAny tips are highly appreciated. Have a fantastic day!",

Get a part time job (not online) to cover your expenses\n2. Since you are a writer, why not write an e-book and try to sell it online\n3. E-Commerce is also an interesting business. Go for drop shipping so don't have to hassle for product manufacturing, keeping inventory and shipping\n4. Sell a physical product online. It's only possible if you do some market research and identify what product is in demand. Then identify the manufacturer/supplier and build a business model around it\n5. Blogging reap rewards only when you successfully bring a lot of traffic and also when your content is of value. So being a writer, my advice is not to give up on blogging. \n\nWishing you all the best and have a great day",

I noticed your post right away because I'm also a self-employed person who makes a living online.  I'll share a few ideas, and then I'll PM you and offer you a small gig to see if we can cooperate and make some money together.\n\n1.)  First, use your brand name to create some social media accounts. Write some blog posts about your brand name.  Write some reddit posts that include your brand name; do an AMA at r/iama DO THESE THINGS using your brand name, so that when each thing you publish gets some search visibility it will be easy for you to post classified ads and tell people, \"Check out my brand with a google search!\" When they see that you have a lot of \"web presence\", they will know you're legit because they'll see that you're well-established.  \n\n2.) Target the hot traffic. This tip is so important, I almost hesitate to share it.   I feel like it has been the key factor that made it possible for me to stay alive and living indoors all these years.  If you want to get hired as a writer (you may doubt yourself, but I can tell from your writing in this post that you can help a lot of people as a writer-for-hire) or translation or visual design, or anything else, post to **classified ads**.  Classified ads are the hottest traffic.  Post to the places where people are actively looking for someone to hire right now.  That is a lot better than running a FB ad campaign, IMO, because classified ads are seen by people in the moments when they are ready to buy. \n\n3.) Offer a TRIAL for a low price.  Give the buyer the option to pay only $10-$20, just enough that they feel invested in doing business with you but not so much that they hesitate to open their wallet.  \n\n4.) Tell them you'll finish it a few days before the deadline so they can have extra time with it.  \n\nI'll pm you right now to see if you and I can do a small amount of work together, helping to advertise each other's stuff.  And if you have ten minutes to spend brainstorming, you can go to [freelancerchurch.com](https://freelancerchurch.com) and listen to the 10-minute clip called \"The Freelance Warrior Typing Meditations\".\n\nGood luck with everything!",

If you teach all their available classes in the morning, you make $40 for 2:40 of your time allotted to this, albeit with ten minutes per hour free to take a breath and get your thoughts together, and ten minutes per hour checking into the classroom, testing that there are no IT problems and greeting the students.  That works out to about $15 an hour if you get the bonuses that bring it up to $10 per class, and $12 an hour if you don't.  \n\nNot being paid for the break time between classes is something to keep in mind about all these companies, although it ends up having a less pronounced effect when you have shorter breaks between classes.  \n\nIn any case, teaching online can be a great gig if you've got the requirements and you don't mind the odd hours. There are a lot of options, though, so I'd encourage anyone interested in this to do their research, think about what's important to them in terms of the different options, and apply to the company that fits them best. There's more info on /r/OnlineESLTeaching, or you can search on facebook or youtube. There's a lot of great info out there on all these companies.",

Plenty of people have had success teaching English and often get paid between 15-20 an hour. I'd imagine that being able to teach multiple languages would be to your benefit.   \n\n\nCaptioning/transcription in English is a pretty low paying job from what I've heard, but if you're bilingual you may be making more. Still, even as low as sites like Rev pay, you could be making 400 a month if you set your mind to it. My suggestion would be to come up with a list of services that you would qualify for and try a lot of them out. After you've got an idea of how they work for you start with the highest paying one and get as much as you can out of it then continue that trend down your list.\n\n  \nI can't vouch for these sites, but they came up when I googled translator jobs and English teaching jobs:  \n\n\n [https://moneypantry.com/translation-jobs/](https://moneypantry.com/translation-jobs/)   \n\n\n  \n [https://www.goodairlanguage.com/teaching-english-online-2/](https://www.goodairlanguage.com/teaching-english-online-2/)",

I look forward to more suggestions here and in pm. Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello guys how are you?\n\nMy brother had graduate from university and entered the military and came back with damage legs that prevent him from barely being able to walk, so he's in a wheel chair. He's been pushing through and had a deal with a very kind landlord that supports veterans and disabled and was using Mturk to make ends meet. Which worked for about a year and a half.\n\nHowever, due to rising costs, it's not longer realistic for him to pay the previous rates, and being unhirable to most places in his position he has to work online. He needs to be able to make a real wage on-line, he has plenty of time for work, 8-12 hours a day available depending on the circumstances, which with most jobs would give him a good penny to put it mildly but he needs to find a job like that online.\n\nBasically he needs a job that has instant, or only requires a few days before approval and it has to pay significantly more than Mturk (where he was just managing $500 a month which is really low wage. Sometimes rarely a $700 month), and as much as Mturk reddit was helpful in the past (which we thanked recently) it's time for real online work, especially works that will pay him well for the amount of time he has available (8-12 hours)\n\nHe can't do transcription jobs, not only is he bad at it but he wouldn't be able to use a foot pedal anyway.\n\nWe thank anyone who is able to give us some suggestions, if you are uncomfortable or know of special suggestions that you don't want to post feel free to direct message me, otherwise, we'll take any and all realistic suggestions so that he can be able to sustain himself, and I can have a peace of mind knowing my brother is doing fine, he deserves it after what he's been through. It's really important.\n\nThank you...",

I would have earned more if I continued with that pen name but the genre wasn't that exciting to me.\n\nThis is a perfectly plausible source of income, and if you treat it like a job it can pay you like a job. I have a circle of author friends and acquaintances who are all making good money on Amazon. The best of us are easily clearing six figures a year, and their advice is always about consistency.

His books and blog focus on self-development, travel, and lifestyle (microbusiness) entrepreneurship. \n\n**The Book’s Main Idea**\n\n*“This book is for those who take action and those who provide the inspiration.”*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\nThe $100 Startup is a business-centric book whose aim is to help prospective entrepreneurs become aware of the challenges that come with creating a successful small business that generates enough revenue to allow the entrepreneur to escape the 9-5 rat race and start living a ‘rich’ life. \n\n*“The new reality is that working at a job may be the far riskier choice.”*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\n**A look at the main ideas shared in the book**\n\nThe book shares the following main ideas:\n\n**1: Passion + good business sense is the magic formula** \n\n*“The missing piece is that you usually don’t get paid for your hobby itself; you get paid for helping other people pursue the hobby or for something indirectly related to it.”*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\nThe secret to all success is simple really: *capitalize on your passions but do so with good business sense by looking into how you can turn your skills (or passion) into a workable and successful product/or service.* \n\nAim to strike what Chris calls convergence, a state where your skills or passions are valuable in the sense that they intersect with the things/elements other people find useful. If you can strike this convergence and from it, package your passion/skills into a service or product a specific audience would find invaluably useful—in that it serves a purpose such as helping solve a problem—you will create a successful business because: \n\n*“Passion or Skill + Usefulness = Success*\n\n*Or*\n\n*“(PASSION + SKILL) –> (PROBLEM + MARKETING) = OPPORTUNITY”*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\nFor someone starting out in entrepreneurship—perhaps starting with $100 or less—to aim for this convergence, ask yourself, “Which skills or passions can I package into a valuable service,” or “what am I good at that I can offer to a ready audience?”\n\n*“Ask three questions for every idea: a. How would I get paid with this idea? b. How much would I get paid from this idea? c. Is there a way I could get paid more than once?”*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\n**2: Where great business ideas come from**\n\nIf you have ever wondered where great ideas come from, Chris offers invaluable insight. He notes, “*Great ideas are everywhere. They are seized opportunities from an emerging technology, or a solution to a hidden or glaring problem.”* \n\nTo find a great business idea, aim for convergence of your passion and what is useful to others, but also cultivate a deep understanding of your target audience not based on conventional targeting wisdom—targeting audiences based on age, gender, income, etc.—but based on what matters the most to the people you intend to serve: \n\n*\"What do people really, really want? At the end of the day, they want to be happy, and businesses that help their customers be happy are well-positioned to succeed.\"*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\n**3: Your success depends on the actions you take**\n\nSuccess—business or otherwise—is not that complicated really. All you truly need to do is take action; yes, spend time planning—because failing to plan is planning to fail—but more importantly, spend more time acting. This is the secret to small business success.\n\n*\"There's nothing wrong with planning. But you can spend a lifetime making a plan that never turns into action. In the battle between planning and action, action wins.\"*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\nWe are fortunate enough to live in an age where all the information we could ever need to succeed in our lives and businesses is readily available to us. At the click of a button, you can test business ideas, launch a microbusiness, and grow it into a thriving business. Without action, however, creating any sort of business success is impossible because:\n\n*“Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work.”*\n\n*Chris Guillebeau*\n\nBeing an entrepreneur or microbusiness owner calls for what Chris calls, “planning as you go” or “bias towards action.” This means finding that convergence and then getting started with implementing your idea right away by creating and launching a prototype of your product/service. With the product/service in play, you can “learn and plan as you go” and scale your business. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll business success comes from action taken at the right time. As long as you can create something a specific audience will find valuable, you can create a low-startup cost business around it.",

I just want to let everybody know to be careful when applying to some jobs. I was contacted today by \"Data Plus\" for a job position. I was invited to chat with them over Google Hangouts, and within 10 minutes realized it was a scam. They told me they were going to send me a check for \"supplies\" and then I can start working. This is the 3rd time somebody has contacted me and pulled this on me. Are there any true work from home positions that don't require contact over Google Hangouts? I researched this company before I applied and I saw everybody saying it was a legit company so I'm kind of bummed. Anytime somebody mentions to be contacted over Google Hangouts, my scam sensors start going off. I just want to let people know just to be careful and if it seems to good to be true, it probably is.

Last week, county commissioners voted to look into building \"telecommuting centers\" so county employees can work in buildings closer to their homes.\"\n\nIt makes me wonder if their jobs require them to be really in an office and cannot be done from home. Anyway, this is a great thing that more people would have the option to telecommute and this is a step on the right direction in removing traffic from their daily commute.",

        "title": "Freelancing: The alternatives to Upwork",
        "text": "Greetings everyone.\n\nAs many of you may know, starting next month Upwork will start charging $0,15 per connect. You will need between 1 and 6 connects to apply for a gig, and previously (now) you used to get 60 free connects per month. This means that what used to be free will be $9 from now on, and that you will be charged between $0,15 and $0,90 just to apply for a job.\n\nWhether the new Upwork pricing politics are fair or not is up to discussion, but many members in this subreddit have complained about it and are looking for alternatives to the popular freelancing site. Here I am to provide some of them.\n\n(DISCLAIMER: Please excuse the formatting. I'm on mobile but will try to fix sometime later).\n\n1/ Freelancer. This one is probably the most similar to Upwork. In addition to applying for gigs and other similar features of Upwork, Freelancer offers contests, where you compete against other freelancers to test your skills (and earn $$$). NASA uses Freelancer to host contests for 3D modeling, graphic design, electronics, software architecture... \n\n2/ Guru. This one is quite similar to Upwork in terms of funcionality. There are way less jobs posted compared to Upwork or Freelancer, but it is still a great sites to find gigs from time to time. Remember that competition will be lower as well.\n\n3/ Fiverr. I don't consider Fiverr strictly as a freelancing platform but I know some do. Its name comes from \"five\", because the most basic services from freelancers are $5. Here you won't find people looking for freelancers, but rather freelancers offering services. Businesses or individuals wanting to hire someone to do something (anything really) will search for it on the platform and pay whoever has the best reviews/pricing. I think Fiverr has the most competitive marketplace of all platforms listed, and there are some horror stories out there about Fiverr closing accounts with money in them. But the good news is that you won't have to pay 15 cents each time a prospect visits your listed services.\n\n4/ PeoplePerHour. I have never tested this platform, but I will do in a near future. From what I have read, prices from freelancers on this platform are cheap, so you will probably have a lot of competition for that sweet $2/hr (just what I guess). Despite of that, most reviews I have found online talk good things about PeoplePerHour, so definitely worth to check.\n\nThere are a lot of other freelancing sites out there, and some of them are specialized in a single trade (graphic design, for example). I have listed the most used ones, by both clients and freelancers, but I will add others if there are various people that want to know about a specific platform (no bullshit reviews like those you will find in listicle articles from Forbes).\n\nIf I had to pick just one, I would go with Freelancer, but try not to put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify between platforms and even try to look for other income sources. You would be grateful to have an established presence in the Fiverr marketplace right now if you had started years ago.\n\nAnd as a general tip: do not undervalue your work.\n\nHappy freelancing and good luck out there for everyone!",

Fiverr is slow as they have moved with the pro service with this the people who are not pro's hardly get any orders. \n\nI feel like am lost as I don't live in the US.

What really makes transcriptions hard is bad recordings, thick accents, mumblers, and people who talk over each other.\n\nPlus, of course, software is doing a bunch of it now. I suspect all the easier stuff is being done by the machines and we're getting stuck with the harder stuff. (Or maybe it's just my aging ears.)\n\nMan, I wish I'd been doing this back in the '80s. I had a SIL who used to make like $30 an hour back in the day, when $30 an hour went a lot farther than it does now. Even with the years of experience I have, and my typing speed of \\~80 wpm, I'm lucky to be making $10-15 an hour. I'm always on the lookout for something else to do.

Since tech is such a big business, a lot of companies are starting up and with this, a lot of jobs in development and 'advance' IT jobs are popping up, with some lovely earning potential.\n\nWith that said, learning to computer program isn't all that difficult. But becoming a programmer to the level needed to actually become employable is a BIG challenge. A lot of people take Computer Science degrees (considered one of the hardest degrees with Physics, Engineering and of course anything Medical), and this this leave with a good understanding of how it all works and makes learning programming fairly 'easy'.\n\nHowever there are Software Developer courses found online (linked to a good website comparing them). You can easily get your feet wet ALOT of free resources covering majority of languages. I'd highly advice trying a Python or Java course first, fairly simple languages to grasp. \n\nStarting out is easy, but printing 'Hello World' on the screen isn't going to make you $100k a year. You've got to become good, really good. Without a degree to back you, working on personal projects and getting involved in projects is the best way. Github is an excellent resource for this, where programmer around the world see what other programmers are up too (also good version control).\n\nI'm not sure what all these \"Learn to program in 3 months\" courses are all about. But I doubt they're any good. Its all about practise.\n\nThis is a good video to open up the world of coding\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFwa5Owp0-k&t=466s\n\nCompare online courses\n\nhttps://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/online-coding-courses-11513890/2\n\nI DON'T ADVICE paying for anything until you give the free stuff a try.

Some of these clips were things I did at my office job, but many others were gigs I found on Craigslist for cheap or for free. Many small non-profits can always use extra help--try reaching out and seeing if there's anything they need written to help promote their services or an upcoming event.",

Blogging? Video scripts? Video games? Social? Direct response? Etc)  get feedback on your site. Maybe take a creative advertising class. They often have local night classes. The one is my area (Los Angeles) is called ‘Bookshop’ Also check out Udemy, skillshare etc. for classes. Once you have a decent portfolio get on freelance sites like Workingnotworking, modern copywriter, and of course LinkedIn. Enter into those crowd sourced sites that ask for ideas for video scripts / tag lines etc. if you win you can show off your published work on your site.",

It is time consuming to sit with their website open and wait for a test you qualify for to come through, but they want testers from all different sorts of demographics and this is the only site I’ve found that consistently pays out and provides enough work to be worth it. \n\nAlso, perhaps try transcription with Rev.com.
